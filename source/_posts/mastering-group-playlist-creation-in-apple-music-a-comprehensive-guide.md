##  How to Create a Collaborative Playlist on Apple Music

 It's super easy to create a collaborative playlist on Apple Music. To begin with, open the [Apple Music app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-music/id1108187390) on your iPhone and tap the "Library" option. Then, choose "Playlists."

![Playlist option in the Library option of the Apple Music app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/playlist-option-in-the-library-option-of-the-apple-music-app.jpg) 

 Tap the "New Playlist" option or open an existing playlist.

![New Playlist option in the Apple Music app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-playlist-option-in-the-apple-music-app.jpg) 

 Enter a title for your playlist and add an image if you like. Then, tap "Create."

![Creating a new playlist in the Apple Music app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/creating-new-playlist-in-the-apple-music-app.jpg) 

 Select the collaborator icon at the top.

 Turn on the "Approve Collaborators" toggle if you want to manually approve who can join your playlist using the link. Otherwise, leave it off to allow anyone with the link to join. Tap "Start Collaborating" to confirm.

![Start Collaborating option in the Apple Music app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/start-collaborating-option-in-the-apple-music-app.jpg) 

 Share the playlist link with your friends using any app you like.

 That's it! Your friends can either join the playlist directly by tapping on the playlist or request access, depending on whether you turned on "Approve Collaborators."

##  How to Manage Collaborators on Apple Music

 If you've enabled the "Approve Collaborators" toggle, your friends will see a "Request to Join" option when they open your playlist invitation. You'll need to manually accept the request for your friend to join the playlist.

##  How to Stop Collaborating or Leave a Collaborative Playlist

 You might run into a situation where you don't want your collaborators to add more songs or edit the ones already in the playlist. In that case, you'll need to stop the collaboration. To do this, open the playlist, tap the collaborator icon, and select the "Stop" button next to Collaboration.

##  What You Need to Use Collaborative Playlists on Apple Music

 There are two requirements to use collaborative playlists on Apple Music. First, you must ensure your iPhone is running on iOS 17.3 or later. To check the iOS version, open the Settings app, tap "General," and then select "Software Update." You must [update your iPhone](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-webcam-guide-5-best-options-with-mic-integration/) if the iOS version is 17.2 or earlier.
