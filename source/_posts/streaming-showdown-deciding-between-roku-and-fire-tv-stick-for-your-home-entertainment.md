 Pros

* Affordable Wi-Fi 6 technology
* Great coverage
* Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6

 Cons

* Requires mobile app for initial mesh set up
* Lacks built-in VPN server

 Although mesh Wi-Fi systems provide fantastic coverage, they can get pricey. So, while you're not going to find an excellent mesh system on the cheap, Linksys' Velop MX12600 comes close, giving you three mesh units for about the same price that most others charge for only two.

 Linksys isn't cutting any corners on performance despite the more affordable price. This Velop Wi-Fi 6 system provides the best range of any mesh system in its class, with three units able to handle homes of up to 8,100 square feet. Thanks to Linksys' mobile app, it's also a cinch to set up.

 Like most mesh Wi-Fi systems, you'll drop the Velop units in critical areas around your home to give you the best coverage where you need it. You also get plenty of wired ports on each unit for hooking up devices that don't have Wi-Fi, and even a [USB port](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166) so you can conveniently pop in a flash drive with your favorite photos so everyone in your home can access them.

 Pros

* Very affordable
* Strong Wi-Fi signal
* Easy setup

 Cons

* Limited positioning options

 Picking out an affordable router that delivers excellent range can be tricky, but fortunately, there’s TP-Link’s Archer C80, a rare gem that will give you solid coverage around a large home with a price tag that won’t be too hard on your wallet.

 While the Archer C80 doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the more expensive routers on our list, it delivers where it counts, punching out a surprisingly powerful signal to reach the far corners of your home.

 This router packs a surprising amount of performance-boosting technology for a router in its price range. While this means TP-Link had to cut a few corners on some of the advanced features, it still manages to handle the important things like basic parental controls and a quick and easy setup through its mobile app.

 The only downside is that it struggles with streaming and gaming on multiple devices. So, if you have a busy family, this probably isn’t the router for you.

* Speedy performance
* Full home coverage
* Great design

 Cons

* Older devices complicate things

 As a [mesh Wi-Fi system](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178) , the Orbi is all about giving you the best performance and coverage by letting you place multiple “satellite” units around your home in the places where you need the best signal. If you’re like most families, you’ll probably want one in the living room or rec room for smooth Netflix streaming on your smart TV and lag-free gaming on your Xbox or PS5\.

 Need even more coverage? You can buy additional Orbi satellite units to spread a wider net of coverage throughout your home. This one is straightforward to set up and provides excellent features like sophisticated parental controls and lots of room for connecting your wired devices.

 Pros

* Advanced Wi-Fi 6 Support
* Extremely fast performance
* Cutting-edge game-centric QoS

 Cons

* Large footprint
* Pricey

 Yes, this router looks like a beast, but it also has the performance to match, with the power of a desktop computer packed inside. This allows it to handle all the demands of gaming traffic, delivering a lag-free performance that means you won't see everything freezing up just as you're about to make that critical shot. And there's still power and range to spare for everyone else in your home, with the eight antennas covering a three-story, five-bedroom home.

 Like other Asus routers, this one has features, but it tucks them away for those who want to get up and running with the basics quickly. As a gaming router, however, it also has many special tricks to give you the fastest performance, and while you can read all the details in our full review, suffice it to say this is a router that will genuinely help you up your game.

 We’re already big fans of Netgear’s Orbi—one of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems you can buy—and now there’s a version with the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology that pulls out all the stops to give you incredible performance throughout your home. It doesn’t come cheap, and if we’re being honest, it’s probably more than you need right now, but this one is more about investing for the future.

 This offers the same great coverage as the classic Orbi system but significantly boosts the speed and the number of devices it can handle. You’ll get the best performance from newer Wi-Fi 6 devices, but it also takes the much more common Wi-Fi 5 devices. This means you get excellent performance today that will get even better as you upgrade to the latest smartphones, tablets, and laptops, nearly all of which come with Wi-Fi 6 built-in.

 It’s also ready for the fastest multi-gigabit internet plans, as it’s built from the ground up to deliver raw speed to wired and wireless devices throughout your home. Our testing showed that even a single Wi-Fi 6 Orbi station could cover a moderately sized home well enough, so a standard two-pack means you’ll likely never have to worry about dead zones.

 Pros

* 8 gigabit LAN ports
* Free security and parental controls
* Includes USB-C port

 Cons

* Bulky design
* Limited antenna adjustment

 TP-Link's Archer AX6000 may be a less attractive router on our list, but it checks all the right boxes. It supports the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology, has solid performance, and has a range boost feature to ensure you can get online even when you're out in your backyard.

 What makes the Archer AX6000 stand out is the free lifetime access to the company's HomeCare security suite. While many other router makers charge you a monthly subscription fee if you want to access their best parental controls and other security features, TP-Link is throwing these in for the router's price, and it's not skimping on them either.

 You can block websites by age categories, set up time limits for internet access, and see which websites your kids visit and how much time they spend there.

 Pros

* Sleek design
* 5Gbps Ethernet port
* Supports link aggregation for multi-gigabit internet plans

 Cons

* Security features require ongoing subscription
* USB ports can't be used for printer sharing

 Unlike the Orbi, Netgear isn’t going for subtle here—the RAX120 is part of the company’s flagship Wi-Fi 6 router lineup, and Netgear is making it clear this is a powerful, futuristic router.

 Unlike the spidery look of traditional long-range routers, the RAX120 hides its eight antennas inside those sweeping wings for a much classier look, but they’re still ready to punch out a strong signal that can cover your entire home.

 An impressive set of wired ports around the back gives you plenty of room for wired devices, and there’s even a high-speed one should you need that for gaming or connecting other high-performance systems. Netgear also offers some of the best security and parental controls available, although sadly, you’ll have to pay an extra subscription fee to take advantage.

 Pros

* Outstanding coverage
* Very easy setup

 Cons

* Not ideal for busier households

 Ubiquiti’s Amplifi HD focused on doing one thing and doing it very well, and that’s getting the maximum range possible from a mesh Wi-Fi system. It provides an unparalleled range for those who need to cover a sprawling estate, although it’s essential to remember that it won’t win any speed records. Ubiquiti may be able to bend the laws of physics a bit here, but it can’t break them outright, and one of those laws is the farther a wireless signal goes, the weaker it gets.

 In practical terms, the Amplifi HD can deliver up to 20,000 square feet of wireless coverage. This is enough for casual web surfing and checking your messages from longer distances. Still, it provides a connection long after most other routers have given up.

## What to Look For in a Long-Range Router

### Wireless Standards

 There is a wide range of [wireless standards](https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553) based on different radio wave spectrums. When shopping for a long-range router, the bottom line is to ensure that it can offer good performance and range on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.

 Signals in the 2.4GHz frequency range travel farther, so you usually won't have a problem with these on any router, but if you want the maximum speeds in the far corners of your home, you'll need a router that can punch through a strong 5GHz signal too.

### Security

 High-end, long-range routers often come equipped with advanced security features such as firewalls and current encryption standards such as WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) that block suspicious activity on your network. Other security features to look for include support for router-level VPN implementations.

[VPN stands for Virtual Private Network](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-vpn-5189778) , and when you use one, your data is sent through a secure, encrypted connection that obscures your identity from prying eyes.

### MU-MIMO and Beamforming

 MIMO (multiple in, multiple out) is a method for coordinating numerous radio antennas in a wireless network. MU-MIMO (the MU stands for Multi-user) is a variation of MIMO designed for 5GHz 802.11ac Wi-Fi networks. It improves the performance of connections made using it. Essentially, MU-MIMO is a technology that enhances the performance of long-range routers.

[Beamforming](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-beamforming-4171262) is another technology designed to improve performance in routers. Traditional routers are omnidirectional, casting a signal over a wide area, diluting the signal. In the case of routers with beamforming, the signal is directed to devices that connect to the router in a concentrated beam that improves signal strength.

 For this reason, your new long-range router will likely have an array of antennae. Rather than send equal signals in all directions, these antennas can be aimed toward areas of the house that need extra signal strength.

 FAQ

* How do you know if you need a long-range router?  
 While dead zones and dropped connections are apparent indicators that it’s time to get a long-range router, problems like lagging and buffering on services like Netflix or choppy video calls on Zoom and FaceTime can also be a sign that your current router just isn't cutting it. One way to help find the best router for your needs is to use a network analyzer such as [Netspot](https://www.netspotapp.com/wifi-detection.html) , a free tool that can help you get a map of your Wi-Fi coverage and identify dead spots or areas prone to interference.
* Should you get a long-range router or a Wi-Fi extender?  
 If you’re having problems getting wireless coverage in one specific area in your home, [Wi-Fi extenders](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-wi-fi-extenders-work-5069898) can be a quick and cost-effective alternative to replacing your entire router. However, you’ll almost always be better off getting a long-range router if you can afford it, as that will expand the coverage in every direction, making things easier in the long run.
* Do faster routers provide better range?  
 Not necessarily. You'll get the fastest possible speeds from any router when you’re sitting beside it, but those speeds can quickly fall off as you move farther away if the router can't deliver a strong, focused signal. The best long-range routers are designed to create a powerful signal that can travel farther around your home while penetrating obstacles such as walls and floors.
* Should I buy a mesh network instead?  
 Traditional long-range routers rely on sheer brute force signal strength to cover a wide area. On the other hand, a mesh network uses multiple routers broadcasting the same signal to create one extensive network with faster speeds than traditional Wi-Fi extenders since they're designed to work together for maximum performance. They also allow for future expansion if necessary. However, mesh networks are a more expensive system.
