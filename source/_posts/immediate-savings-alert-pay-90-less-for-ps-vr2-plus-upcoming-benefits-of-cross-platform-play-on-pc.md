## Immediate Savings Alert! Pay $90 Less for PS VR2 + Upcoming Benefits of Cross-Platform Play on PC

Excited about PC connectivity coming to the PSVR2 but don't own the headset yet? Save $100 now, and be ready in August.

 In August, [the PlayStation VR2 will be able to hook up to your PC](https://howto.techidaily.com/full-solutions-to-fix-error-code-920-in-google-play-on-infinix-note-30-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), allowing you to play games from SteamVR with Sony's headset. This will make the PSVR2 one of the most versatile [VR headsets](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/visual-harmony-ios-and-macos-photoviewer-blend/), as you'll be able to play both PlayStation's VR titles and your PC VR collection.

 So why wait until August, when you can get it on sale now? As part of Sony's [PlayStation Days of Play Sale](https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/deals), you can [save $100 on the PlayStation VR2](https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003526&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fpsvr2-deal%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), bringing the price down to $449.99\. For comparison, the [Meta Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/) starts at $499.99 for the cheapest model without any [accessories](https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-recover-deleted-pictures-on-note-30-pro-without-backup-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/)—when you factor in the upcoming versatility of Sony's headset, this is a pretty great deal.

 Also, if you're a PS Plus member and buy the headset from [PlayStation Direct](https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2), you'll get [a year of free Netflix](https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/netflix). Given [how expensive the streaming service has gotten](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/emystifying-video-seo-on-youtube-as-a-novice/)in recent years, this is a really valuable perk.

 As for the PSVR2 itself, the headset offers 4K visuals, 3D audio, and a 110-degree field of view. In short, you can fully immerse yourself in your VR gaming experience. You'll also get intelligent eye-tracking, which the Meta Quest 3 sadly lacks. There are some disadvantages to the headset, namely that it's wired, but in terms of specs, the PSVR2 is a great headset. The main thing holding it back was it being tethered to the PS5's somewhat limited VR offerings, but that will soon be a problem of the past.

 All things considered, this is a great deal for a great headset.

I would recommend buying [the version that takes discs](https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim) and paying a little extra, but if you only own or want to buy digital games, the [Digital Edition console](https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim) is also available.
