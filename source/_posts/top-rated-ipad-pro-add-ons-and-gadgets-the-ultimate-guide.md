##  What to Look For When Buying iPad Pro Accessories

 Compatibility is the first and most important factor to consider when buying iPad Pro accessories because two sizes are available—an 11-inch and a 13-inch model. Of course, a case designed for the 11-inch iPad Pro will not fit the bigger iPad Pro, so make sure the accessories you buy are compatible with your Pro's size.

 Purpose is another key factor to consider when choosing iPad accessories. What will you be using your iPad Pro for? For instance, if you're a digital artist, a stylus becomes a must-have to improve your productivity. On the other hand, if you plan to use your device solely for content creation, you'll want to consider accessories such as [ring lights](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/enhancing-productivity-zoom-features-for-windows-users-win10/).

 Another critical factor to consider is budget. After splurging on the latest iPad Pro, how much more money can you spend on accessories? If you're on a tight budget, your options may be limited.

 Most people also consider aesthetics when making purchases. Do you want accessories whose colors closely match those of the iPad Pro? Other iPad Pro users may like to stay on-brand by buying Apple-only accessories for compatibility and uniformity. If looks are important to you, then the price is worth it.

 The iPad Pro is one of the most popular tablets. It is renowned for its aesthetics and performance and has a characteristic slim form factor. If you’ve just purchased or are eyeing the latest iPad Pro, you’ll want a case that doesn’t add extra bulk. For this, we recommend the [ZUGU iPad Pro Case](https://www.amazon.com/Protective-Pencil-Holder-Multiple-Viewing/dp/B0D438GCD1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), one of the best iPad Pro cases available.

 Made from [Thermoplastic Polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU), this ZUGU protects your iPad Pro against everyday wear and tear, spills, bumps, and scratches while offering up to 5 feet of drop protection. It also comes with precision cutouts matching all the iPad Pro ports and buttons and an Apple Pencil holder.

 The ZUGU iPad Pro Case has a sleep and wake cover, which automatically turns your iPad Pro on and off depending on whether the screen is covered. This helps preserve battery life by minimizing display or screen timeout, and this sort of feature is always a plus. Even better, this iPad Pro case also has an Apple Pencil holder that will charge your stylus when not used.

 Finally, the magnetic stand supports up to eight adaptive angles, so you can find the perfect angle whether you're drawing, watching Netflix, or doing anything else.

 You can get the ZUGU iPad Pro Case in [11-inch](https://www.amazon.com/Protective-Pencil-Holder-Multiple-Viewing/dp/B0D42Y8Q2Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [13 inch](https://www.amazon.com/Protective-Pencil-Holder-Multiple-Viewing/dp/B0D438GCD1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) sizes.

 While an iPad case protects your iPad Pro, its screen is still vulnerable to damage or scratches. To prevent this, you’ll need a screen protector, such as the [Ailun iPad Pro Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Ailun-2024-Generation-Anti-Scratch-Compatible/dp/B0CZ6VDPY6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It is easy to install and offers dependable protection for your iPad Pro device.

 The Ailun iPad Pro Screen Protector is made from tempered glass and comes as a pair, just in case you need a second or the application of the first doesn't go too well. Additionally, it comes with two camera lens protectors to prevent scratches or damage to your iPad Pro camera.

 The Alium iPad Pro Screen Protector is case-friendly, so you can pick up any [iPad Pro case](https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unleash-your-creativity-the-best-online-stop-motion-animation-studios/) and use the screen protector without any worries. If you’re worried about your Face ID working or not, rest assured that the Alium iPad Pro Screen Protector is Face ID compatible.

 It is also compatible with the Apple Pencil, allowing you to take notes or draw as if you were working directly on the native iPad Pro screen. Finally, the protector has an [oleophobic coating](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-online-partnerships-crafting-brand-joint-ventures-on-youtube/) and offers high transparency with night vision support.

 The Ailun iPad Pro Screen Protector is available for both the [13-inch iPad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Ailun-2024-Generation-Anti-Scratch-Compatible/dp/B0CZ6VDPY6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and the [11-inch iPad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Ailun-11-2024-Generation-Compatible/dp/B0CZ74RHYN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 A case and screen protector are essential iPad Pro accessories, and picking them up will always be worth the investment. However, if you take many notes or are a visual artist, you’ll agree that the iPad Pro is incomplete without a stylus. There are [third-party options](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-create-a-digital-signature-online-for-fodt-file-document-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-word-sign-a-word/), but there is no better choice than the [Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The Apple Pencil Pro offers one of the best experiences with the iPad Pro—which is not a surprise if you've used an Apple Pencil with your iPad in the past. With this latest version of the stylus, you'll get ultra-low latency connections with imperceptible lag, offering next level real-time performance. It also offers pixel-perfect precision with tilt and pressure sensitivity, making it ideal for painting, sketching, doodling, or note-taking on the iPad Pro.

 The Apple Pencil Pro is an improvement over the [Apple Pencil (2nd Gen)](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), but it's important to note that this stylus is only compatible with the M4 iPad Pros and the M2 iPad Airs. If you have an older iPad Pro, you'll have to settle for the second-generation Apple Pencil instead.

 The iPad Pro is a powerful mini computer. However, typing on a big screen can feel awkward, especially if you're used to the haptic feedback of a keyboard. If you do a lot of typing on your iPad Pro and want a comfortable keyboard that does a lot more than just typing, we recommend the [Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch-ipad-pro.920-012658.html).

 The Logitech Combo Touch delivers an enjoyable and familiar typing experience, whether texting, sending an important email, or working on an essay for class. If you’re working at night, its built-in 16-level adjustable backlight ensures you can continue typing or working even in the dark.

 This keyboard also features a prominent trackpad that lets you use familiar iPad Multi-Touch gesture controls, which aren't always available on third-party keyboards. You'll also get a full row of iPadOS-specific shortcut keys, making the Logitech keyboard even more versatile.

 The Logitech Combo Touch also doubles as a detachable case, meaning you can use it instead of a dedicated case if you want to carry the keyboard with you. It also acts as a stand, allowing you to easily FaceTime, watch movies, or sketch.

 You will need to pay for all of these features—the Logitech Combo Touch isn't a budget keyboard. But it's well worth the investment if you're looking to use your [iPad as a laptop replacement](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722972482843-corsair-void-pro-windows-driver-download-and-installation-made-simple/).

 If you’re traveling or taking a long-distance flight, a good pair of headphones or earbuds can make a world of difference. Even if you're not out and about, headphones can take your music to the next level. Regardless of which camp you fall into, the [Apple AirPods Max](https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a perfect match for your iPad Pro.

 As an Apple product, your iPad Pro will pair seamlessly with the AirPods Max without any lag. Secondly, it features [active noise cancelation (ANC)](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-sharing-twitch-on-your-fb-page-for-2024/), ensuring that outside distractions will not filter through.

 The Apple AirPods Max is made from high-quality materials. Finally, you'll enjoy precision controls and a long-lasting battery. It's really the premium iPad Pro audio experience.

 However, if price is a concern and you still want an Apple product that pairs well with your iPad Pro, we recommend the equally powerful but smaller [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It offers ANC, superb call quality, and supports Personalized Spatial Audio. It now comes with multiple ear tips (XS, S, M, L), so you shouldn't need to resort to third-party ear tips for a comfortable fit.

## FAQ

### Do iPad Pros charge via USB-C or Lightning cables?

 iPad Pros now charge via USB-C to computer system or power adapter like the [Apple 20W USB-C Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003513&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-ipad-pro-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Apple shifted from Lightning Cables to USB-C beginning with the iPad Pro (3rd gen). However, you can still charge earlier model iPads with a Lightning port using a USB-C to Lightning Cable. 

### Is there a difference between the iPad Pro 11-inch and 13-inch other than size?

 Yes, but the differences are minor. For instance, the iPad Pro 13-inch (M4) uses an eSIM9 while the iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) uses an eSIM10\. They also differ in weight (1.28 pounds for the 13-inch and 0.98 pounds for the 11-inch) and price. Other than these, they're basically the same thing under the hood.

### Can I use any pair of headphones with the iPad Pro?

 As long as you are within 10m (33 feet) of the Bluetooth device, you can use third-party headphones with the iPad Pro. Note that the latest iPad Pros do not have a 3.5mm audio jack.

### What is the difference between an iPad Pro and the standard iPad?

 Standard iPads are entry version iPads while iPad Pros are the highest version iPads. Standard iPads are cheaper, smaller, use a less powerful chip, lack Face ID support, and generally have less features than iPad Pros. The current standard iPad is the iPad (10th generation) while the latest iPad Pro is the iPad Pro M4.
