##  What to Look for in a Gaming SSD in 2023

 There's nothing more frustrating as a gamer than staring at a loading screen. Games are getting bigger and more graphically impressive, and as a result, they're taking longer to load. That's why it's important to [have an SSD](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-gradual-glide-out-technique-for-audio-in-adobe-premiere-pro/), as they can drastically improve boot and load times in addition to making your games feel smoother and more responsive. But with so many options on the market, how do you choose the right one?

 The first main factor to consider is storage capacity. Depending on how much space your system still has, you may want to get a higher capacity since a single modern game can take up to over 100GB of storage. Gaming SSDs usually range from 125GB to 4TB, but the price gets relatively more expensive per GB.

 However, with games increasing in size, you'll want to consider getting at least 500GB or 1TB of storage, especially if you plan having multiple games downloaded at once. Opting for a lower-capacity SSD for a boot drive is fine, but you never know when you'll need the extra space. While you're thinking about storage, make sure you also choose an SSD that's compatible with your PC or console.

 Next are [read and write speeds](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-total-takeover-of-powerdirector-with-our-2024-review/). The fastest SSDs available are [PCIe 4.0](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-quickcapture-stopping-and-saving-screen-moments/) drives with read speeds up to around 7,000 Mb/s and write speeds at 5,000 Mb/s. PCIe SSDs are also known to be much faster than their [SATA counterparts](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/accelerate-windows-1n-1-effective-solutions-for-enhancing-system-speed-and-responsiveness/).

 For longevity, purchasing an SSD with a [heat sink](https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-compatibility-issues-with-corsair-icue-software-on-windows-11/) is a better option than without one as it helps to dissipate heat better. The cooler your SSD runs, the longer its lifespan will be the more consistent it'll perform. Having a higher [terabytes written rating (TBW)](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/securing-your-documents-a-step-by-step-guide-to-password-protecting-text-files/) is also important as it's a measure of how much data can be written to the drive over its lifetime.

 Now that you know what to look for in a gaming SSD, let's take a closer look at the best options available.

| Pros                                       | Cons                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| â Great price for monster performance      | â Maximum storage capacity of 2 TB |
| â All components are manufactured in-house | â 2 TB version is expensive        |
| â Still a great option for PCIe 3.0 users  |                                    |
| â PlayStation 5 compatible                 |                                    |
| â Five-year warranty                       |                                    |

 The [Samsung 980 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLX7TNT?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a $230 1TB high-performance SSD that uses the latest PCIe technology that fits into most modern PCs and consoles. It delivers read and write speeds up to 7,000 Mb/s and 5,000 Mb/s respectively.

 For a little less than double the price, you can upgrade to [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RK2SR23?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Depending on the number of applications, programs, or games you want to run at lightning speed, getting the extra storage space might be worth it.

Related: [PCIe 4.0: What's New and Why It Matters](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-quickcapture-stopping-and-saving-screen-moments/) 

 The Samsung 980 Pro uses [PCIe Gen 4 technology](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-quickcapture-stopping-and-saving-screen-moments/) designed for hardcore and competitive gamers that want more and faster bandwidth while gaming. It's also ideal to run any demanding application that's [heavy on graphics](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-lava-yuva-3-pro-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 To provide stable and consistent performance, as well as longevity, the 980 Pro offers reliable thermal control using a nickel coating that effectively dissipates heat. The drive's designed to last, as it has an impressive [terabyte written](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/arabic-for-beginners-a-step-by-step-guide/) (TBW) rating of 300 TBW at 500GB up to 1,200 TBW at 2TB.

 The 980 Pro is also fully compatible with PlayStation 5 and PCIe 3.0 rigs. However, installing the drive in a 3.0 slot will limit the speeds--it'll still be over 3,000 Mb/s. You can also install [Samsung Magician](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsemiconductor.samsung.com%2Fconsumer-storage%2Fsupport%2Ftools%2F) to update firmware and further optimize the drive's performance and monitor its health.

| Pros                                      | Cons                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| â Great performance considering the price | â Slower than PCIe 4.0 options |
| â Good read and write speeds for PCIe 3.0 | â Low TBW rating               |
| â Excellent cost per GB                   |                                |
| â Five-year warranty                      |                                |

 If you're looking for a speed upgrade, but you're on a budget, you might consider going with a PCIe Gen 3 drive instead of the more recent Gen 4\. The [Crucial P3](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PCIe-NAND-NVMe-3500MB/dp/B0B25LQQPC?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent budget pick, starting at less than $50 for 500GB, and it comes from a brand with an excellent reputation.

 The [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PCIe-NAND-NVMe-3500MB/dp/B0B25LZGGW?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) version costs you slightly more at around $65, or you can increase to [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PCIe-NAND-NVMe-3500MB/dp/B0B25MJ1YT?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) at just under $125\. There is also a [4TB](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PCIe-NAND-NVMe-3500MB/dp/B0B25P44CL?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) version, but this isn't the most cost-effective option at over $300\. Unlike the previous generation, there is no difference in write speeds between capacities.

 While you won't get the same speeds you would with the latest version of NVMe, the Crucial P3 still offers decent performance with sequential read speeds up to 3,500MB/s. Write speeds are only slightly slower at 3,000MB/s.

 Assuming you're upgrading from another NVMe drive, you may not notice much difference in speed. That said, if you're upgrading from a hard drive setup or even SATA drives, you'll definitely notice the difference in speed.

 Regarding longevity, Crucial claims a TBW rating of 440 TBW for the 2TB model. This may be lower than some other options, but Crucial does offer a five-year warranty, which means the company stands behind the P3.

 If you're looking for a bigger upgrade and want a PCIe 4.0 version, the [Crucial P3 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Plus-500GB-PCIe-5000MB/dp/B0B25NTRGD?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers faster read and write speeds.

Best Budget SSD for Gaming

#####  Crucial P3

$40 $60 Save $20 

While they rely on older PCIe 3.0 technology, Crucial's P3 SSDs offer excellent performance for that generation, and they cost far less than you'd expect given the performance.

| â Great performance, especially for the price | â Slightly power hungry at idle |

 If you're buying an SSD for gaming, two things are important: speed and capacity. The major strength of the [Crucial P5 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Plus-PCIe-NAND-6600MB/dp/B098WKQRDL?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is just how much of that speed storage you get for the price.

 While they aren't the absolute fastest you'll find, the P5 Plus still offers respectable speeds with read speeds of up to 6,600MB/s and write speeds of up to 5,000MB/s. When you consider that you can get 2TB for $150, that's pretty impressive.

 This is a PCIe 4.0 NVMe drive, but it's backward compatible with PCIe 3.0\. This means that if you're buying an SSD for an older machine with the idea of eventually moving it to a new computer, this is a perfect match.

 The P5 Plus is available with or without a heat sink. Whether you'll need one or not largely depends on how much time your drive will spend in use, but when in doubt, opt for the heat sink, as it will extend the longevity of your SSD.

 Without a heatsink, you can find the Crucial P5 Plus in [500GB](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Plus-PCIe-NAND-6600MB/dp/B098W1NDV2?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Plus-PCIe-NAND-6600MB/dp/B098WL46RS?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Plus-PCIe-NAND-6600MB/dp/B098WKQRDL?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) options.

 Corsair's [MP600 PRO XT](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F5Z6BJ6?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the few gaming SSDs that you can purchase for up to [4TB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F5XC93H?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) of storage. It is pricey, but this SSD delivers serious read and write speeds up to 7,100 Mb/s and 6,800 Mb/s respectively.

 The MP600 PRO XT is a powerful PCIe Gen 4 gaming SSD that effectively combines performance and endurance using high-density 3D TLC NAND. This is in addition to the aluminum heat spreader that disperses heat and reduces throttling. It also integrates a liquid-cooling option that sets it apart from other options.

 The drive leverages NVMe Protocol 1.4 to provide maximum bandwidth. Combined with the heavy-duty heat sink, the MP600 PRO XT is one of the best 4.0 SSDs for those who value consistent and fast speeds. The 1TB and 2TB versions have a 700 TBW rating, but it jumps to an astonishing 3,000 TBW at 4TB.

![WD BLACK SSD on motherboard](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WD-black-sn850x.jpg) 

Western Digital

| Pros                                    | Cons                 |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| â Great performance overall             | â On the pricey side |
| â Faster than the previous SN850 model  |                      |
| â Heat sink adds to the SSD's longevity |                      |
| â 5-year warranty                       |                      |

 While the Xbox Series consoles limit you to pricey proprietary storage, the PlayStation 5 makes it much easier to expand the internal storage. If you need more space, you can't go wrong with the [Western Digital WD\_BLACK 2TB SN850X](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7CKZGN6?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 As the name implies, this is essentially the WD\_Black SN850 with increased speeds. This new drive features write speeds up to 7,300MB/s and read speeds up to 6,350MB/s, which is nearing the limits of the PCIe 4.0 spec.

 If you've paid attention to the guidelines for [finding the right SSD for your PS5](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-assessing-acid-pro-top-alternative-software/), you're probably aware that Sony recommends a heat sink. The WD\_BLACK SN850X features said heat sink, which will help extend your SSD's life, meaning you don't need to worry about replacing it.

 Heat sink aside, Western Digital specs its WD\_BLACK drives at 600 TBW, which means even if you're constantly ready and writing tons of data, the drive will last. Unless you plan to use your PS5 20 years from now, you shouldn't worry about upgrading the drive.

 With the heat sink, the Western Digital WD\_BACK SN850X is available in [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7CKVCCV?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7CMZ3QH?tag=htg-v2-1u4tiis-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206295&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797223%2Fbest-ssd-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) varieties.

It's a USB-3.2 Gen 2 x2 SSD that's compatible with PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Mac.

The read and write speeds remain the same for all capacities, so you can choose one based on how much storage you need.

 The P50 offers decent speed for an external SSD but is still slower than your average PCIe 3.0 drive. However, you'll still have no problem booting up your system and quickly hopping into the action of your favorite games or transferring files.
