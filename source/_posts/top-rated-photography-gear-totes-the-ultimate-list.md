##  How to Choose the Best Camera Bag for You

 If you have a camera, you need a camera bag. Even [compact point-and-shoots](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-a-lost-vivo-v27-for-free-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) need compact camera bag protection. But a camera bag is essential for anyone [stepping up from smartphone photography](https://driver-error.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-fixing-invalid-or-unverified-driver-installs-on-computers/) to the most accomplished DSLR user. But there are so many different types out there, so which one is best suited to you?

 There are backpacks, shoulder bags, sling bags, and many other different types of camera bags. The style depends on your needs. A backpack will hold multiple lenses and additional gear. It may even have room for more than one camera body, depending on the capacity. They are ideal for anyone going on long shoots or traveling.

 Shoulder bags are smaller but offer quick access and are suitable for short shoots and small setups. They’re also ideal for photographers who stick to the same lens or two during a day's shoot, such as the 35 and 50mm prime lenses [often favored by street photographers](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimizing-video-quality-youtube-to-mpeg-conversion-strategies/). Then there is the sling bag, which is smaller than a shoulder bag but is more like a fanny pack that slings over the shoulder.

 But there are additional things to look out for in a camera bag. Padding is vital, especially for on-the-go photographers who might subject their bags to the odd bump or two. Inner compartments are also essential to separate the gear and prevent the lenses and camera bodies from knocking and scraping against each other. Of course, this is more important with bigger camera bags that hold more equipment.

 You must also consider weather resistance and waterproofing and know they [are not necessarily the same](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-examining-benq-sw320-the-4k-visionary/). A weather-resistant bag is designed to give you time to get out of the rain or snow. If it’s waterproof, your gear should be safe, at least for a longer period. However, it’s always best to double-check manufacturers’ bold claims.

 Additional features to look out for include build quality, tripod attachment options, extra pockets for [accessories](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/mastering-pinterest-content-top-5-free-download-apps/) like batteries, memory cards, or filters, and a laptop compartment if you carry one.

##  Best Camera Bag Overall: [Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II](https://amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B5654S3P) 

![A man hiking with a Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II on his back.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/lowepro-protactic-bp-450-aw-ii.jpg) 

_Lowepro_

| Pros                                      | Cons                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| Durable and comfortable                   |                                       |

 If you want to cut to the chase and buy the best overall camera bag, our top pick is the [Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II](https://amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B5654S3P). It’s a professional-grade backpack ideal for pros and amateurs who carry a substantial amount of gear. With a design to fit one or two camera bodies, this backpack can also hold multiple lenses and accessories; there’s even space for a 15-inch laptop. It’s a rugged bag that offers superior protection, is comfortable to carry, and features a versatile inner modular system and multiple access points.

 The backpack has a 25L capacity and internal dimensions of 11.8 x 6.3 x 17.3 inches (30 x 16 x 44 cm). It comfortably fits at least one professional camera body, such as the Canon 1D X Mark IV, or two smaller bodies, such as the [Nikon D3500](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004451&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNikon-D3500-DSLR-Camera-Body%2F686739681) or the [CanonEOS Rebel T8i](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&cuid=UUhtgUeUpU2004451&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCanon-EOS-Rebel-T8i-24-1-Megapixel-Digital-SLR-Camera-with-Lens-0-71-2-17%2F477390105), as well as multiple lenses and accessories. And, with access points on the top, rear, and either side, getting to all your gear is quick and convenient, ensuring you always have the chance to capture that critical moment.

 The bag is comfortable to wear, thanks in part to the ActivZone back panel, which allows air to circulate, reducing heat and humidity and keeping your back cool. Additionally, the straps are broad and well-padded, and you can adjust the removable belt to balance the weight between your waist and shoulders. This belt also converts into a handy utility belt, which you can fit with a range of included accessories.

 LowePro’s FormShell construction offers excellent protection for your gear. The outer is well padded, the base is thick, and the lid is sturdy yet flexible. The inner modular dividers consist of rigid polystyrene foam core, while even the corners are well protected.

 The laptop compartment uses a CradleFit design that keeps your device off the ground. Furthermore, an all-weather cover safeguards all your equipment against rain, snow, dust, and sand.

_Tarion_

| Pros                               | Cons                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Excellent value for money          | Zippers may not be as sturdy as premium bags     |
| Straps for tripod attachment       | Not a good choice for professional photographers |
| Storage space for a 13-inch laptop | Rain cover is not fully waterproof               |
| Customizable padded dividers       |                                                  |
| Lightweight yet durable            |                                                  |

 The [TB-S from Tarion](https://amazon.com/dp/B08SBR83TF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004451&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-camera-bags%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the ideal backpack for beginners on a budget. With a total capacity of 12L, it provides ample storage for one camera body, up to six lenses, and a 13-inch laptop. Additionally, it offers customizable inner compartments and a front pocket for accessories.

 Its lightweight design and inconspicuous appearance also make it a good choice for everyday use, and it’s the ideal budget-friendly backpack for traveling amateur photographers.

 The bag measures 14.6 x 5.5 x 11.2 inches (37 x 14 x 28.5cm), which is very spacious at this price point, and weighs just 1.8lbs (0.8kg). It’s easy to carry, as long as you don’t pack it too tightly, and it also comes with what Tarion claims is a waterproof cover. However, you should take this claim with a pinch of salt, as the cover may not handle extreme weather. This rain cover will repel a bit of rain and light snow, but it may not be advisable to rely on it once the heavens open.

 However, the TB-S is sturdy and comfortable to carry. The shoulder straps are adjustable and well-padded, and inside are seven compartments that you can customize to hold various lenses. On the bottom, there are straps to attach a tripod or monopod, and the sides feature mesh pockets to keep a water bottle or something similar.

 When you need a travel backpack that can double as a camera bag, Peak Design is an excellent brand to turn to. With the [Peak Design Everyday Backpack V2 20L](https://amazon.com/dp/B07ZTQ7VJ9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004451&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-camera-bags%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you get a bag that does just that. It’s ideal for on-the-go vloggers and bloggers, traveling amateur photographers, and anyone seeking a quality backpack. With customizable internal FlexFold dividers, which you can reconfigure without needing to re-velcro, and easy top and side access, it’s perfect for carrying photography equipment and daily essentials while on the go.

 While it may take a little practice, the specially designed MagLatch clasp on the top can be very handy for photographers. Once you’re used to the design, you can access the bag much more quickly than you could with a regular zip or buckle. And after mastering it, you’ll soon be able to open the bag one-handed, adding an extra layer of convenience.

 However, it should also be noted that the bag's capacity is, in fact, 17L. The MagLatch clasp enables expansion to 20L. When expanding the capacity, the top of the bag can become misshapen and even make the weight distribution unbalanced. If this doesn’t appeal, or you need room for more gear, Peak Design has a [30L V2 bag](https://amazon.com/dp/B07ZTP5CBQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004451&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-camera-bags%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for you.

 The Everyday Backpack V2 can hold a DSLR camera body with a lens attached and 2-3 additional lenses. You can also store a laptop or tablet in the U-shaped laptop sleeve. This design prevents your device from touching the ground. Also, it allows for easier access and a snugger fit for sizes up to 16 inches. Externally, four carry straps and a Cord Hook system for securing bulky items, such as a tripod.

 The mesh padding on the back is vented and quick-drying. In milder climates, this provides effective breathability. However, it may not provide optimal airflow in hot conditions, especially when loading the backpack to capacity. The bag also features adjustable shoulder straps that are effective when you haven’t packed too tightly and a clever, quick-connect, magnetic sternum strap.

 Billingham is an English company that has been in operation since the early 70s. For a long time, the company has been synonymous with quality, and its camera bags have even been endorsed by legendary photographers such as David Bailey.

 The [Billingham Hadley Pro 2020](https://amazon.com/dp/B07VS99S32?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004451&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-camera-bags%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a recent update of the company’s most classic bag. It’s a handcrafted premium-quality shoulder bag designed for photographers who value durability, style, and functionality.

 With dimensions of 16.1 x 6.3 x 11 inches, the 8.5L capacity can hold a DSLR (without battery grip) or mirrorless body and between 2 and 4 small—to medium-sized lenses, including one unattached 70-200mm telephoto. The padded insert is conveniently removable, and the leather straps are designed for closing the bag only. At the other end of the straps are effective quick-release fasteners for opening the top flap, giving photographers easy access and more time to capture fleeting moments.

 The classic Hadley Pro aesthetic remains despite functionality improvements to the top handle and the addition of weather-sealed zippers and a luggage trolley retainer strap. It’s available in khaki or black canvas and tan leather and is refined in its appearance.

 But it’s not just about looks and capacity. The Billingham Hadley Pro 2020 is also highly durable with its high-quality, weather-resistant canvas, premium leather straps, and solid brass buckles that add strength and a touch of sophistication. The bag’s resistance to the elements is fortified with a three-layer waterproofing system that includes a butyl rubber layer that protects contents during inclement weather.

| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Premium all-natural Italian leather | Limited capacity for gear             |
| Shockproof interior lining          | Not ideal for poor weather conditions |
| Lightweight and compact             |                                       |
| Multiple pockets for accessories    |                                       |
| Available in six colors             |                                       |

 One camera bag that combines style and functionality at an affordable price is the [Torres Mini from MegaGear](https://amazon.com/dp/B076ZRBQDP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004451&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-camera-bags%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This is a messenger bag that stands out thanks to its premium, all-natural Italian leather that exudes a classic feel. But it not only delivers a luxurious look—the interior is lined with heavy-duty shockproof material, protecting your equipment from bumps and short drops. Its premium material also gives the bag long-lasting durability, appealing to any photographer who values aesthetics and robust quality.

 With dimensions of 8.5 x 7.5 x 4 inches (21.6 x 19 x 10.2 cm), it’s not a large bag. It can only accommodate a single mirrorless or a small- to medium-sized DSLR and one or two lenses. But, with multiple pockets outside and inside, you have plenty of room for your accessories and other items. It’s also lightweight, compact, easy to carry, and ideal for all-day shoots or travel.

 It features a 53-inch removable crossbody strap and a robust buckle to secure your gear, and you can choose from six eye-catching colors. However, the leather build means it isn’t a safe bet to use in poor weather. If the clouds are rolling in before your shoot, staying home and waiting for better conditions might be better.

### What's the difference between a camera bag and a backpack?

 Essentially, the main difference is how they are carried. A backpack obviously goes on the back, while a camera bag is usually held in the hand or slung over a shoulder. 

 Camera bags generally offer photographers easier and quicker access to their gear. Additionally, they are usually of a smaller capacity and a more compact design. This makes them a suitable choice for when carrying less equipment or when going on short shoots.

 A backpack, on the other hand, is ideal for longer shoots, traveling, and when carrying a lot of gear. They offer plenty more storage than a regular bag, allowing you to fit more cameras and lenses and all the accessories you need. A good backpack will ensure weight distribution is optimal, meaning you can lug all your hardware around more comfortably and for longer periods.

### How well will a camera bag protect a camera?

 How well a bag protects your camera depends on several key factors. You need to consider the material first. High-quality materials, such as ballistic nylon, can withstand the rigors of everyday use. Thick padding is also essential to absorb shocks and protect your gear. Any good camera bag will also have protective internal dividers to separate your cameras and lenses.

 Always check the bag's specifications to see if it features weatherproofing. However, some manufacturers may make exaggerated claims about how effective it is, so it’s always best to read customer reviews when possible.

 Other protective features to look out for are impact-absorbing base panels. It would also help if these panels featured waterproofing, too. Furthermore, reinforced corners give additional protection against bumps and drops.

 However, while a good safeguarding camera bag is essential, it’s also important to take care of your expensive equipment yourself. Treat your camera and lenses with care, and always put the lens cap on during storage. Put a lens hood on whenever possible, and be gentle when placing your bag on the ground.

### Are camera bags allowed on planes?

 Yes, camera bags are generally allowed on planes. That is provided the bag falls within the airline’s carry-on size and weight limitations. If you are lugging around a lot of gear, you may incur fees in order to be allowed your camera bag onboard. 

 With a lot of equipment, you may also be subject to additional scrutiny at security checks. There’s also the point of battery regulations. However, the 100Wh limit set by the TSA shouldn’t affect any camera battery.
