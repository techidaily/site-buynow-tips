##  Ring Isn't Your Only Option

 With [Amazon raising the prices of Ring subscriptions](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/xbox-one-screen-capture-guide-step-by-step-instructions/), now is the perfect time to start looking for alternatives. Ring might be one of the most well-known names in the world of smart homes, but it's far from your only option.

 Wyze, Google Nest, Simplicity, Arlo, and more are creating smart products that offer the same functionality as Ring---and some are even available at much more attractive price points.

 There are a few things to remember when hunting for Ring alternatives. The first is price. If you don't mind spending a similar amount on a replacement, consider checking out products from Arlo or Google Nest. You'll also need to consider monthly subscriptions, as some manufacturers lock features behind a monthly paywall.

Related: [Amazon Is Raising Prices on Ring Protect Basic Subscriptions](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/xbox-one-screen-capture-guide-step-by-step-instructions/) 

 Compatibility with your current smart home setup is another factor to consider. However, most of today's smart products offer robust software that makes them easy to use even if they can't sync with the rest of your home. All of the products on this list will do just that!

 Also, take note if a central hub is required. These are typically offered as a secondary purchase, and while they'll add to your initial setup costs, you'll benefit from additional functionality and the option to easily expand your setup later.

 Whether you're looking to replace your doorbell or install a new security camera, here are some of our favorite Ring alternatives.

 The first thing you'll notice about the [Google Nest Doorbell](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery-snow%2F6473256.p%3FskuId%3D6473256) is its sleek design. Offered in four different colors ([Snow](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery-snow%2F6473256.p%3FskuId%3D6473256), [Linen](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery-linen%2F6473268.p%3FskuId%3D6473268%23anchor%3DproductVariations), [Ivy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery-ivy%2F6473257.p%3FskuId%3D6473257%23anchor%3DproductVariations), and [Ash](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery-ash%2F6473259.p%3FskuId%3D6473259%23anchor%3DproductVariations)), the gadget blends in with your home while also giving it a futuristic flourish.

 Aside from looking stylish, the Nest Doorbell is every bit as functional as the competition. HD video, night vision and HDR support, a high-quality speaker and microphone for two-way audio, and an array of lights to indicate its status ensure the Nest Doorbell is packed with every feature you'd ever want from a video doorbell.

 This [battery-powered version](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery-snow%2F6473256.p%3FskuId%3D6473256) is our favorite (thanks to an easy setup process and universal compatibility), but you'll also find a [wired version](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-wired-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell%2F6172796.p%3FskuId%3D6172796) if you don't mind a bit of added installation.

 The only drawback to the Nest Doorbell is the reliance on a [Nest Aware](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest%5Faware?hl=en-US) subscription. Like most [video doorbells](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-the-secrets-of-ios-visual-data-repository-for-2024/), you'll need to spring for a monthly subscription to unlock the most powerful features of your smart gadget. This includes access to smart alerts to let you know if a friend or stranger is at the door and the option to view a video history of the day's alerts.

 There's plenty of functionality without a subscription, and with its simple setup, sleek design, and powerful [companion app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU205635/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US), the Google Nest Doorbell is a great alternative to Ring.

 While many customers use the [Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Pro-Spotlight-Camera-Wire-Free/dp/B08L746NXW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F810929%2Fbest-ring-alternative%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) outdoors, nothing is stopping you from taking its waterproof design and using it inside your home. Its diminutive footprint makes it easy to place anywhere from the living room to your entry foyer without becoming conspicuous, and a staggering 160-degree capture angle means you'll have a nearly panoramic view of what's happening in your house.

 The capture angle is impressive, and the footage is captured in 2K with support for HDR, providing you with a crystal-clear image. And if you do notice something strange, you can activate a siren to let intruders (or a mischievous animal or child) know that you're watching.

 The Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight Camera is a premium device, and with that comes a premium price tag. You can save a bit by bundling multiple cameras, but a single camera retails for $200\. It's a bit steep, but you're undoubtedly getting what you pay for.

 Best of all, if you decide to switch up your security system, you'll be able to take the Arlo Pro 4 outside without worrying about how it will perform. It is a jack-of-all-trades camera, and anyone seeking the best should consider it seriously.

 If you can look past its chunky design, the [Nest Cam](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgoogle-nest-cam-battery-snow%2F6473262.p%3FskuId%3D6473262) has a lot going for it. Most importantly, it comes with a high-quality camera that captures 1080p footage with HDR support. You'll also benefit from night vision, letting you see what's happening around your home even after the sun goes down.

 One of the Nest Cam's often overlooked---but not less critical---features is the ability to capture an hour of footage and store it in its local memory. That means if the power goes out or something else happens to services in your area, you can rest easy knowing that the Nest Cam is still doing its job.

 Rounding out the package is two-way audio, the ability to review event history, notifications when the camera is triggered, easy installation, and a waterproof design that'll withstand even the most brutal storms.

 Like the [Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/the-6-best-sim-unlock-services-that-actually-work-on-your-realme-11x-5g-device-by-drfone-android/) mentioned above, the Google Cam comes with a hefty price tag, but you're getting one of the best products in the business.

 Few products offer the versatility and ease of the [SimpliSafe Wireless Home Security System](https://www.amazon.com/Home-Security-System-Monitoring-Protection/dp/B07GXVSMT5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F810929%2Fbest-ring-alternative%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The 12-piece set includes a base station, a keypad, five entry sensors, two motion sensors, a panic button, an indoor camera, and a key fob.

 Once you've placed everything where you want them and synced them together, your home is fully protected. The entry sensors can be placed on windows or doors to let you know when they're opened. The motion sensor alerts you when there's motion inside your home. The indoor camera makes it easy to check up on things when you're away, and both the base station and key fob make it easy to arm and disarm the system.

 It truly is a full-fledged security system in a single box, and while its $400 price tag is steep, you're getting a lot of value for your money. You'll also get the added convenience of a simple setup and a [powerful app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU205635/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplisafe.mobile&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) to control the action.

 It's a bit pricey when not on sale, but the [Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084TTKWHM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F810929%2Fbest-ring-alternative%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is worth every penny. Boasting a sleek design and impressive illumination skills, the Pro 3 Floodlight makes it easy to light up your yard and keep intruders at bay.

 Unlike some floodlights, the Arlo Pro 3 floodlight is entirely wireless. That means you won't have to meddle with rewiring your home or contacting a professional to take care of the installation. Instead, you'll need to download the[companion app](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/arlosafe.html) on your phone, mount the floodlight's base to the side of your home (or wherever you wish to install it), then sync it with your smartphone.

 Once installed, you'll benefit from a wide 160-degree viewing angle, 2K footage with HDR, and a quick alerts system that lets you know whenever motion is detected on your property. The floodlight can produce up to 2,000 [lumens](https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/choosing-between-the-classics-an-in-depth-look-at-nintendos-lite-vs-oled-variants/) on its own, or you can ramp it up to 3,000 lumens by connecting the [outdoor magnetic charging cable](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/accessories/VMA5600C-100NAS.html).

 The biggest downside to the Arlo floodlight is the same as it is for most smart home cameras---many of its best features are locked behind a paywall. You'll need to spring for an [Arlo Secure plan](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/arlosecure.html) to gain access to smart activity zones, person and animal detection, cloud storage, smart notifications, and more. These start at $5/month, although a free trial is included with your purchase. Beyond that caveat, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight should be a great addition to any smart home.

With 16 million colors to choose from and a variety of control options, these stylish, well-built lights are a great alternative to the Ring Pathlight.

You can set timers, multiple lighting zones, and even have the lights automatically come on when you arrive home using proximity detection on the Hue app.

 You don't have the solar option as you do with Ring pathway lights, but connecting them up to an outside power source is easy and safe, and at least ensures a constant light level no matter the season. Each light kit contains the cables you need to daisy-chain to the next one, so extending your pathway lighting is also simple.

 There are more contemporary pedestal styles available in Philips outdoor lighting range, but if you want a more modern look while also saving a few bucks, these [Atomi Smart Pathway Lights](https://www.amazon.com/Atomi-Smart-WiFi-Pathway-Lights/dp/B08PHRKX2Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205635&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F810929%2Fbest-ring-alternative%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) are also well worth considering.
