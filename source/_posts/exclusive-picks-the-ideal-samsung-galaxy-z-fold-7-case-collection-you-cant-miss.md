##  What to Look for in a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 case

 All Galaxy Z Fold 5 cases are not created equal, and there are some key factors to consider when looking for the best cases for Galaxy Z Fold 5.

 Basic protection against wear and tear, scratches, scuffs, and smudges is a must. Cases in this roundup tick all these boxes, with some going the extra mile and offering hinge protection.

 The fit is also important. With an improved design, [Galaxy Z Fold 4 cases](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-commanders-clash-the-ultimate-ranking-of-7-total-war-games/) won’t fit your Galaxy Z Fold 5, so you'll need something specific for the new phone that fits snugly but doesn't impact functionality in any way. The Z Fold 5 also features a new and slimmer S-Pen than the Z Fold 4\. If you own and use one, you may want a case with a compatible S-Pen slot.

 Watch out for bulk. The [Galaxy Z Fold 5](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-the-art-of-compelling-mosaic-imagery/) is already pretty bulky when folded. Bulky cases will add to that and make it heavier and thicker, which could cause problems with fitting the phone in your pocket or while holding it. However, bulky cases are generally rugged and offer more protection, so it's a balancing act.

 Wireless charging support may also be important for you. Some rugged cases may be too thick to allow wireless charging, and continuously removing and re-fitting a case can cause the corners of the cover to become loose. Thankfully, you won't need to unwrap your Z Fold 5 each time you want to charge it wirelessly because the cases in this roundup all support wireless charging.

 There are also useful extras like key rings and kickstands that make a case more than just a protective cover and should be considered, depending on your use case.

 And finally, there's the price. The [Z Fold 5](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-z-fold5%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-z-fold5-512gb-unlocked-sm-f946uzkexaa%2F) is already as expensive as it gets. You shouldn’t have to spend a fortune to protect it. This roundup includes cases for every budget, offering different levels of protection and some nice extra features.

It costs less than $20, and while its build quality isn't great, it manages to hold its own against pricier cases. For instance, It offers decent drop protection, has raised bezels, and comes in a matte finish.

 It also features an S-Pen cutout which is more deep set and compatible with the new and slimmer S-Pen, and also doubles as hinge protection. ALCase's offering supports wireless charging and comes with precision cutouts for easy access to ports and buttons. You also get a built-in screen protector, even though the user experience hasn't been particularly impressive with it. You can also add a splash of color with the AICase for the Z Fold 5, with up to 19 options to choose from.

 Although the Z Fold 5 is slimmer than the Z Fold 4, it is still pretty bulky for most new users, especially when folded. Add a case to the equation, and you could end up with something much bulkier, heavier, and more difficult to handle. If you want to keep things as slim as possible, go for the [Samsung Slim S-Pen Galaxy Z Fold 5 Case](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-z-fold5-slim-s-pen-case-graphite-ef-of94pcbegus%2F), which fits the foldable like a glove.

 This case is also ideal for users who like to stick with first-party accessories. It features a thin profile, solid finish, good grip, and precision cutouts for buttons and ports. But even though it's thin and lightweight, you get protection from scratches, scuffs, and small drops. There's also an S-Pen holder and support for wireless charging.

The Torro Galaxy Z Fold 5 Leather Case is a premium leather case that protects your Z Fold 5 against all forms of scratches and bumps. It also features a wallet to hold your cards and cash, acts as a kickstand, and supports wireless charging.

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TORRO-Phone-Compatible-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B0C8TYQMPR/?tag=htg-v2-21o7be6-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2000118&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-galaxy-z-fold-5-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) [See at Torro](https://torro.co.uk/products/galaxy-fold5-leather-case) 

## FAQ

### What are the differences between the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and the Galaxy Z Fold 5?

 The Galaxy Z Flip 5 features a clamshell design with a 6.7-inch primary display and a 3.4-inch cover display. The Galaxy Z Fold 5, on the other hand, features a book-like design and a 7.6-inch primary display with a 48-120Hz refresh rate. The Z Flip 5 comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB or 512GB of built-in storage, while the Z Fold 5 is available with 12GB RAM and 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage. Another key difference is that you can only use an S-Pen with the Z Fold 5.

### Does the Galaxy Z Fold 5's hinge need protection?

 The short answer is yes and no. Yes, if you can't trust yourself to handle the hinge carefully and can live with the inconvenience of hinge protection and extra bulk. For instance, some cases with hinge protection rock from side to side when opened flat and feel awkward in the hand. No, if you're extremely careful with the hinge and prefer your Z Fold 5 fully opened flat without extra bulk. In any case, the Galaxy Z Fold 5's hinge is pretty sturdy. It features a double rail design and can survive up to 200,000 folds.

### Can I use a Galaxy Z Fold 4 case with the Galaxy Z Fold 5?

 No, you can't use Z fold 4 cases with the Z Fold 5\. Both phones share a lot of similarities in form factor but are slightly different when it comes to the dimensions. The Z Fold 5 is slimmer and thinner than its predecessor. And the improved hinge design ensures that the phone folds flat instead of leaving a slight gap, as was seen with the Z Fold 4\. The differences are minor, but cases require precision fits, so you won't be able to use Galaxy Z Fold 4 cases with the newer model.
