##  What to Look For in a Nintendo Switch Headset in 2024

 A good headset does more than give you a way to communicate with teammates. It can also isolate you from the outside world, providing an immersive gaming experience and producing high-end audio that beats out the Switch's built-in speakers or a low-end home entertainment system. Shopping for the right headset can be difficult, however, as there are hundreds of products on the market---and many of them carry very similar specifications.

 Nintendo Switch's approach to voice chat is a bit convoluted. Many of its games require the use of a [smartphone app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU207158/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znca&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) for communication, with only a handful of games offering built-in functionality for group chat.

 This means not all games will require (or even allow) a headset for communication, and you'll want to double-check your catalog before investing in a headset for Switch. The last thing you'd want to do is buy a fancy headset only to find out you can't use it to chat with friends in your favorite game.

 If you're seeking a headset to have an immersive single-player experience as well as for multiplayer use, you'll need to consider both the included microphone and the performance of the headset's drivers. These internal components create deep bass during explosions and crisp vocals during cutscenes.

 Just because two products both feature 40mm drivers doesn't mean they'll perform the same. Cheaper products tend to cut a few corners with their audio software, resulting in muddy sounds when the action gets intense.

 Once you've figured out which types of games you need a headset for, you'll want to determine the type of connection you're after, as wireless headsets typically cost more than their wired alternatives. Additional features such as a steel-reinforced headband, removal microphone, and premium leather earcups can further increase your price tag.

 It's hard to go wrong with most products from well-known brands such as Razer and SteelSeries, but some headsets simply perform better than others. We've put together a shortlist of the five best Nintendo Switch headsets on the market for a variety of needs.

 Regardless of what you're looking for, these products will check all the right boxes.

##  Best Nintendo Switch Headset Overall: [Razer Barracuda X Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y1FPSD7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Barracuda X Lifestyle (1)](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/barracuda-x-lifestyle-1.jpg) 

A person wearing the Barracuda X headset.

| Pros                      | Cons                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ✓ Impressive battery life | ✗ Unimpressive noise isolation |
| ✓ Powerful 40mm drivers   |                                |
| ✓ Reasonable price        |                                |

 Razer headsets are always among the best in their class, and it's hard to beat the versatility of the [Barracuda X](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y1FPSD7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Offering the perfect combination of price and performance, Razer's premium headset is great for both single-player and multiplayer games—and its durable enough to withstand even the most demanding of travel schedules.

 Powering the action are Razer's TriForce 40mm drivers, which produce vivid sounds regardless of what's going on in your game. The fancy tech is built into an ultra-light design that makes them easy to wear during extended play sessions.

 The only drawback to the design is the Barracuda X's lackluster noise isolation, meaning you'll probably hear a bit of ambient sound leaking in unless you crank the volume all the way up.

 Aside from that minor complaint, there's little else to fault with the Barracuda X. A detachable [HyperClear Cardioid](https://razer.a9yw.net/c/156932/642901/10229?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU207158&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-hyperclear-mic) microphone makes it easy to communicate with teammates in games that allow it, on-headset controls make it easy to control your settings, and you'll get up to 50 hours of playback on a single charge.

 There's no shortage of great headsets available for Switch, but you can start and end your search with the Razer Barracuda X.

| Pros                            | Cons                                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Affordable                    | ✗ Lackluster sound and noise isolation |
| ✓ Variety of designs and colors |                                        |
| ✓ Large earcups                 |                                        |

 Often on sale for $30, the [Turtle Beach Recon 70](https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-Gaming-Headset-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07NH6Q4LB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) headset punches well above its weight class. Its overall sound quality won't compete with some of the premium options on this list, but casual players will benefit from most of the same features you'd find on a more expensive product.

 For example, the Recon 70 offers large, comfortable earcups, a wide selection of colors, and an impressive microphone that automatically mutes when you flip it up into the headset.

 Turtle Beach built the Recon 70 specifically for Nintendo Switch. However, the 3.5mm jack allows it to work on Xbox and PlayStation consoles as well as PC and smartphones with an audio port. So if you're looking for a great headset for all your gaming needs, it's hard to pass up the value offered by Turtle Beach.

 Like the high-end Razer Barracuda X, this budget-minded headset uses 40mm drivers to pump out deep bass and crisp treble—although it's a bit muddier than an audiophile would like.

 Still, there's not much else in this price range that brings as much to the table as the Recon 70\. Combine its specs with its lineup of eight unique designs, and you're bound to find something that fits your needs.

 Turtle Beach's Recon 70 comes in a variety of designs and offers more features than you'd expect for its price, although its overall sound quality can't compete with more expensive headsets.

Best Budget Nintendo Switch Headset

#####  Turtle Beach Recon 70

Turtle Beach is no stranger to crafting affordable products, and the Recon 70 poses one of the best values you'll find for a Switch headset.

##  Best Wireless Nintendo Switch Headset: [SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07X64MTGL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                        | Cons              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| ✓ Steel-reinforced headband | ✗ Awkward earcups |
| ✓ Easy setup                | ✗ Generic design  |
| ✓ Detachable microphone     |                   |

 SteelSeries calls the [Arctis 1](https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B07X64MTGL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) a "4-in-1 wireless" headset, as it's compatible with PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Android devices. Much of that functionality is all due to its USB-C wireless dongle, which makes it easy to quickly connect to your gaming platform of choice. It also works via a standard 3.5mm jack when you don't need its wireless capabilities.

 The Arctis 1 Wireless uses the same premium drivers seen in the expensive [Arctis 7 headset](https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-7)\---giving you high-end sound without the high-end price tag. Its overall design isn't as sleek as the Arctis 7, however, and its flat earcups and generic design might leave you wishing for something a bit more stylish.

 If you can look past the divisive design, there's a lot to love about the Arctis 1 Wireless headset. The drivers might be the main attraction, but you'll also get a steel-reinforced headband for added durability, a removable microphone, and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for low latency audio and voice communication.

| Pros                | Cons                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ✓ Affordable        | ✗ Lackluster sound quality |

 PDP might not have the clout of Razer or SteelSeries, but it's been designing gaming gear for more than three decades. Its [LVL40 headset](https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-LVL40-Stereo-Headset-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B096BJ6MSL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of its latest products, and it's officially licensed by Nintendo for full wired support on Switch.

 The affordable headset comes in a variety of colors, and its lightweight design is perfect for long gaming sessions. Parents will love the durable construction, which helps it survive being tossed on the floor numerous times, while kids will benefit from a headband that's easily adjustable for a comfortable fit.

 While the headset certainly looks great, a few of its materials are on the cheaper end of the spectrum. The entire headset might feel a bit underwhelming in the hands of some owners, but the overall sound quality of the 40mm drivers and vibrant designs should be more than enough to satisfy young gamers.

 And if it does happen to get stepped on or misplaced in a room full of toys, you'll be glad to know the PDP headset is often on sale for just over $20.

##  Best Nintendo Switch Earbuds: [Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Sony XM5 Lifestyle (1)](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/sony-xm5-lifestyle-1.jpg) 

The Sony XM5 Earbuds next to a smartphone and watch.

| Pros                            | Cons        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| ✓ Compact design                | ✗ Expensive |
| ✓ Produces incredible audio     |             |
| ✓ Impressive noise cancellation |             |

 The [Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F781726%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-headset%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) have an awkward name—but don't let that scare you away. Beyond the clunky moniker is a pair of earbuds that are unrivaled on the market, offering high-resolution audio, impressive noise cancellation, and easy setup with the Nintendo Switch.

 While you can sync just about any Bluetooth earbuds with your Switch nowadays, anyone seeking a premium audio experience should consider the 1000XM5\. Inside the earbuds you'll find Sony's Integrated Processor V2, which helps produce rich audio whether you're listening to dialogue or thumping soundtracks.

 Impressive noise cancellation makes them sound even better, as the earbuds use both AI machine learning and snug ear tips for a combination of passive and active noise cancellation, effectively tuning out your surroundings. That makes them great for gaming on a noisy airplane or train.

 Despite all the powerful tech in the XM5s, you'll get up to eight hours of playtime on a single charge and up to 24 hours total using the included charging case. They're also remarkably tiny and sport a sleek, glossy texture and exceptional build quality.

 There's no denying the 1000XM5 Earbuds are impressive, but their hefty price tag could put them out of range for many gamers. But if you don't mind saving up, the Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds will be a great Switch companion for years to come.
