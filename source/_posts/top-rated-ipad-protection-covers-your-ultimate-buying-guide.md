With so many versions of iPads nowadays, it's hard to figure out which case you're even supposed to pick up. Make sure you're getting the right case in the right size with our buying guide roundup!

##  What to Look for in an iPad Case in 2023

 Picking a case for your iPad can be a daunting experience. You need to know what you want the case to do, as well as your budget. A [Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-11-inch/dp/B0931V9M9D?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208500&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F758054%2Fbest-ipad-case%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) might be a great keyboard case many turn to, but given its price, it may not be the best option for you if you don't plan on [using your iPad like a laptop](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722972482843-corsair-void-pro-windows-driver-download-and-installation-made-simple/) a lot.

 Once you know what you plan on using your iPad for, you can start shopping for a case---but you need to make sure you're shopping for the right iPad model! Our buying guides below help you find the right case at the right size.

##  Best iPad (9th Generation) Cases

 While a new generation of the standard iPad is available, Apple is still supporting the ninth-generation iPad. If you're looking to pick up this iPad version, make sure you get the right case. The two generation's cases are incompatible, so double-check which generation you bought.

##  Best iPad (10th Generation) Cases

##  Best iPad Mini Cases

 If you need a compact tablet, look no further than the iPad Mini. This smaller model has all the functionality you love from Apple, but is easier to slide into a purse or bag. It's a perfect [eReader](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/superior-10-mobile-apps-to-edit-your-face/) replacement, as well!

##  Best iPad Air Cases

 The iPad Air is [our favorite iPad model](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-screen-content-on-huawei-mate-10-20-and-p-series-phones-via-built-in-recorders/) for a reason. It's the perfect combination of size, functionality, and price. The Air is a great starting point if you're unsure which model to pick up.

##  Best iPad Pro 11-inch Cases

 More of a tablet power user? The iPad Pro is the model to get. While the 11-inch iPad Pro model is the smaller of the two Pros, it has the same specs as the other iPad Pro model---and is cheaper, as well. Just make sure you grab the right size case!

##  Best iPad Pro 12.9-inch Cases

 There's a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro model in 2022, so if you want the latest, greatest, and most powerful, this is the model to buy. This is also your best choice if you're looking for [a laptop replacement](https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722972482843-corsair-void-pro-windows-driver-download-and-installation-made-simple/).
