##  What to Look For in a Curved Monitor in 2024

 There are [several reasons](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-newbie-friendly-guide-to-winning-with-telegram-promotion/) why you may want a curved monitor. They offer an immersive viewing experience, help reduce eye strain, and have fewer reflections and glare than flat monitors. But it's good to understand a few things before picking one up.

 One of the key ways in which curved monitors are different from flat monitors is, well, the curve. But the level of curvature can be different across different monitors. So, for example, some monitors have a gentler curve, whereas others are more aggressive.

 The level of the curve is specified by the curvature radius, such as [1000R](https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-power-of-creativity-magix-video-pro-x-demystified/) or 1500R. "R" in this label stands for radius, and the preceding number is the circle's radius that would be formed if the monitor was extended all the way to form a full circle.

 The lower the curvature radius, the more aggressively curved a monitor is. So, lower curvature radius monitors provide a more immersive experience at the typical sitting distance of around one meter. When picking a curved monitor, it's essential to account for its curvature radius.

 Apart from the curve radius, the usual features important for any monitor are also essential for a curved monitor. So if you are primarily buying a monitor for gaming, you would want [variable refresh rate](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-guide-sharing-igtv-in-the-world-of-insta-stories/) support, low input lag, and a faster [response time](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-jovial-jamboree-accessing-comic-crafts-for-free/). On the other hand, if you are a creative professional, you would prefer full coverage of different color spaces, such as sRGB, AdobeRGB, or DCI-P3, depending on what you create.

 Lastly, your budget and available space to put a monitor are also crucial. Even the best curved monitor won't be much use to you if you can't fit it on your desk!

 Now that we have gone through the basics, it's time to dive into our recommendations.

| Pros                       | Cons                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ✓ Fantastic color accuracy | ✗ Low contrast ratio |
| ✓ Full coverage of sRGB    | ✗ No local dimming   |
| ✓ 5K2K resolution          | ✗ No VRR on Macs     |

 The [LG 40WP95C-W](https://www.amazon.com/LG-40WP95C-W-UltraWide-Thunderbolt-Borderless/dp/B09P1VLCQ4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an impressive curved screen. Its 40-inch [Nano IPS](https://location-fake.techidaily.com/overcoming-startup-problems-successful-fixes-for-rocket-league-not-launching-properly/) display offers a vivid and lifelike picture, and the 5K2K (5120x2160) resolution is great for multitasking. More importantly, the monitor has fantastic out-of-the-box color accuracy as it comes factory calibrated. You get full coverage of the sRGB and excellent coverage of AdobeRGB and DCI-P3 color spaces.

 The monitor has a solid build quality and comes with a decent set of adjustment options in terms of ergonomics. In addition, the 2500R curve radius is gentle and won't be a big adjustment even if you are coming from a flat-screen monitor.

 LG has packed many connectivity options, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two HDMI 2.0 ports, and one DisplayPort 1.4\. One Thunderbolt port can also deliver 96W of power, enough to keep most [USB-PD](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/) compatible laptops charged. There are two [USB 3.2 Gen 1](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-craft-powerful-tags-for-maximum-youtube-engagement/) Type-A ports onboard as well.

 Although the 40WP95C-W is primarily targeted at content creators, it's also a decent option for casual gaming because of its low input lag. In addition, the monitor natively supports [AMD FreeSync](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/) and has a 72Hz [refresh rate](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quick-guide-sharing-igtv-in-the-world-of-insta-stories/), so there is no [screen tearing](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-preloaded-features-of-chatgpt-functions-and-implementation-tips/). But if you want a fast refresh rate, our best [gaming monitor recommendation](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-detailed-review-optimal-screen-recorders-for-live-broadcasts/) will better serve you.

 Unfortunately, the [contrast ratio](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-ledger-unveiling-the-best-text-generation-apps/) of the LG monitor is low because of its [IPS](https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-great-debate-final-cut-pro-vs-lumafusion-for-video-editing/) panel, and the company hasn't included local dimming. Also, it works great with both Windows and Mac computers, but you [won't be able to use the variable refresh rate feature](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/lg/40wp95c-w) on Mac.

 If you find the LG 40WP95C-W too expensive for your budget, the company's [LG Ultragear 34GP950G-B](https://www.amazon.com/LG-34GP950G-B-Ultragear-Response-Adjustable/dp/B097QF8CP3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent alternative. It has a [QHD resolution](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-binge-worthy-music-reaction-videos-on-youtube/) but offers a faster 180Hz refresh rate.

| ✓ Excellent contrast ratio          | ✗ No USB-C input    |
| ✓ Full coverage of sRGB color space | ✗ 60Hz refresh rate |

 Dell makes excellent monitors, and the company's [S3221QS](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-S3221QS-Ultra-Thin-DisplayPort-Certified/dp/B08G8WMRRP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is no exception. It's a solid [4K](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/) monitor that's perfect for people who don't want to spend a lot. Its 32-inch [VA panel](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-youtube-management-by-studio-techniques/) is crisp and offers a great contrast ratio.

 The creatives will appreciate the monitor's complete coverage of the sRGB color space as well as great coverage of both AdobeRGB and DCI-P3.

 The S3221QS includes two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort 1.2 for video input. However, it lacks USB-C connectivity for single cable operation. If that's a deal breaker, you'll need to look into [another monitor](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-detailed-review-optimal-screen-recorders-for-live-broadcasts/).

 While the refresh rate is limited to 60Hz, the monitor supports AMD FreeSync for a variable refresh rate. In addition, it also provides low input lag and a fast response time for responsive gaming.

 It's a little plain looking as far as design is concerned, but that means it will fit in most surroundings. The monitor's build quality is also good, and you get a 1800R curve radius.

 Unfortunately, however, the Dell monitor has poor ergonomics. As a result, you'll get limited adjustment options to reach your preferred viewing position and will need to work around it. An [adjustable stand](https://www.amazon.com/Monitor-Stand-Riser-Adjustable-Ergonomic/dp/B07NQMC2RB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) can help if you need to lift the monitor up.

 Its 1800R curve is perfect for an immersive gaming experience, and as long as your workflow doesn’t include tons of text or thin lines—such as [CAD software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided%5Fdesign)—the OLED G9 is also a near-perfect productivity choice. 

 Ports-wise, you’re getting a single DisplayPort 1.4, one full-sized [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/), and one [Micro-HDMI](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/a-guide-to-shopping-for-ideal-laptops-at-these-6-best-stores/) 2.1 port, all of which support 240Hz refresh rate at the native resolution of 5120x1440\. 

 The monitor also comes with a remote and Samsung’s [Tizen platform](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-pc-screen-to-honor-magic5-ultimate-phones-drfone-by-drfone-android/), which means you can use it as a smart TV. For example, if you want to stream a TV show on Netflix, you don’t have to turn on your PC—just open the built-in app with the remote and start streaming. 

 When not consuming HDR content, the maximum brightness is high enough to use the monitor in brightly lit environments. Still, you should be aware that, due to the [QD-OLED panel](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solved-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-keeps-crashing/) found here not having a polarizer, blacks look more like grays in bright environments. Other downsides include the innate burn-in proneness marring every [OLED panel](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) and text clarity issues stemming from the unique pixel layout of the Samsung QD-OLED panel the monitor's based on.

 If you’re worried about burn-in but want something similar for gaming, the [Samsung Odyssey Neo G9](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-Monitor-FreeSync-LS49AG952NNXZA/dp/B096YNP6ZR?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn’t offer the same black levels and motion clarity but gets pretty close while providing a superb HDR experience. If you’re looking for a productivity-first monitor, check out the [HP E45c G5](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1762614-REG/hp%5F6n4c1aa%5Faba%5Fe45c%5Fg5%5F45%5Fdqhd.html/BI/22163/KBID/28708/SID/UUhtgUeUpU205432), a marvelous option for any kind of workflow.

| Pros                         | Cons                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✓ 144Hz refresh rate         | ✗ The stand could've been more stable |
| ✓ VRR works flawlessly       | ✗ Less than ideal motion performance  |
| ✓ Full coverage of sRGB      | ✗ Poor HDR                            |
| ✓ Lots of bang for your buck |                                       |

 The [MSI Optix MAG342CQR](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Optix-MAG342CQR-1500R-Curvature/dp/B08S8W3MMM?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the many 34-inch ultrawide options you can get for less than $500 that all come with a curved, 1500R [VA panel](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-youtube-management-by-studio-techniques/), 3440 x 1440 resolution, and 144Hz refresh rate. And among the competition, the MSI Optix MAG342CQR offers excellent value and is one of the best implementations of the said 1500R VA panel. 

 For about $330, you’re getting good enough motion performance at 144Hz for single-player gaming, about 300 [nits](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-build-stellar-youtube-beginnings-on-a-shoestring-budget/) of maximum brightness, enough to use the monitor in bright environments, VRR support, and a versatile stand that isn’t the most stable but supports height, tilt, and swivel. 

 The 1500R curve is just right for an immersive gaming experience. And despite having a VA panel, you can use the MSI Optix MAG342CQR for color-critical work as long as you’re working in the sRGB color space and sit right in front of the monitor. That said, the monitor has a wide color gamut, covering about 90% of the DCI-P3 color space. Despite having a wide color gamut, you shouldn't expect a decent HDR experience due to the middling maximum brightness and the absence of [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/). On the flip side, the contrast ratio here is excellent and way higher than what you’d get with any IPS panel. 

 Note that the MSI Optix MAG342CQR comes with two HDMI 2.0 ports and a single DisplayPort 1.4 connector, with the two HDMI ports topping out at 100Hz at the native resolution. In other words, if you want to have the native 144Hz refresh rate, use the DisplayPort connector. 

 Aside from a little sluggish response time—at least when compared to pricier options—and less than stellar stand stability, the MSI Optix MAG342CQR has no significant shortcomings. If you want something with better motion clarity that sells at a similar price, the [Dell S3422DWG](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Curved-Monitor-Refresh-Display/dp/B095X7RV77?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent choice. Otherwise, I’d advise against buying any of the overpriced IPS ultrawides and recommend aiming for the [Alienware AW3423DW](https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW3423DW-34-18-inch-3440x1440-Curvature/dp/B09VQ48X5Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205432&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F814702%2Fbest-curved-monitor%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Alienware AW3423DWF](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU205432%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Falienware-34-curved-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3423dwf%2Fapd%2F210-bfrp%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories%23techspecs%255Fsection), or any other 34-inch ultrawide OLED/QD-OLED option instead.

 The [Dell Alienware AW3423DW](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU205432%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Falienware-34-curved-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3423dw%2Fapd%2F210-bcye%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories) is the first monitor to ship with the new [QD-OLED](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solved-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-keeps-crashing/) panel. This Samsung Display-made panel offers perfect blacks and lifelike colors. It also gets brighter than the W-OLED panels traditionally used in [OLED TVs](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/discovering-the-best-in-display-tech-10-list-for-your-mac/) and monitors. So you can expect stunning visuals for a great gaming experience.

 The monitor is also filled with tons of gaming-related features, such as a fast 175Hz refresh rate, native support for Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync compatibility, and an FPS counter. Additionally, gaming on the monitor feels responsive thanks to AW3423DW's quick response time and low input lag.

 Among other features, HDR support is present, and thanks to the monitor's wide color gamut and decent brightness, the HDR content is a treat to watch, including in games.

 Ports include one DisplayPort 1.4, two HDMI 2.0, and four USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports. In addition, you can use the USB-A ports to connect a wide variety of peripherals. You just need the space to put the monitor on your desk in the first place, ad this Alienware monitor isn't small.

 As is typical for [OLED](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) panels, the Alienware AW3423DW is sadly susceptible to [burn-in](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-virtual-arena-transcript/). But Dell has included several features to reduce the chances of that happening and also offers a three-year replacement warranty for burn-in.
