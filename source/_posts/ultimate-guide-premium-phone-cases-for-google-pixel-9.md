##  What to Look for in a Pixel 9 Phone Case

 Fit is crucial when choosing phone cases because phone models differ in physical dimensions and button or camera placements. The best cases fit with precision cutouts that allow easy access to all phone ports and buttons. The cases should offer different levels of protection for your phone, including basic and advanced protection. The cases we feature protect your phone against everything from scratches to accidental drops.

 MagSafe compatibility is another factor you may want to consider if you plan on using MagSafe accessories with your Pixel 9 phone. While MagSafe is typically an Apple product feature, there are Android cases on the market that include magnets that make your device MagSafe compatible. Most of the cases we feature support magnetic accessories.

 Since the Google Pixel 9 supports wireless charging, you may also want to look out for cases that won’t interfere with this feature. It may not be a dealbreaker for you, but even if you're not using a wireless charger at home, it can be a helpful feature to have when travelling.

 While shopping for the best Pixel 9 cases, you may also want to consider important extras, such as aesthetics, grippiness, a kickstand, and wallet slots. How much you might need each of these is up to personal preference, so make sure you decide what you want to choose the best case for your needs.
