##  What to Look For in an Ergonomic Keyboard in 2024

 Ergonomic keyboards essentially serve the same purpose as a regular keyboard. The main difference is that an ergonomic option will provide different levels of support to your wrists, hands, or fingers to create a more comfortable typing experience. They're designed to keep the hands and wrists in a natural position, limiting muscle strain and damage.

 That said, there are many different types of ergonomic keyboards on the market. There are a variety of designs, and you'll want to consider what exactly you'd like in your ergonomic keyboard before buying one.

 There are two major categories most ergonomic keyboards fall into. First are the split-design keyboards, which (as the name implies) split the keys in half for more natural wrist positioning. When it comes to these split keyboards, you can get them as two completely detachable halves, or as keys that are still split but still one unit.

 The second type is a concave design, where the keyboard features a curved, concave design that ideally reduces overall finger movement. These are better for you if you're not a fan of having your keys split off.

 Ergonomic keyboards will also have certain features such as thumb clusters, groups of high-frequency keys (enter, space, control) closer to where your hands naturally sit requiring less movement and strain to use.

 You'll also want to consider your choice in connectivity---for example, would you rather have a Bluetooth keyboard, or are you fine with wires that connect to your laptop or desktop? Additionally, some keyboards are a better fit for Windows devices, while others can be used on both Windows and Mac.

 Our list contains several options, from wireless connectivity to the best keyboard and mouse combination, allowing you to find the best pick for your needs.

| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✓ Uses an Alice ergonomic layout                        | ✗ Alice layout has a learning curve |
| ✓ It's a fantastic mechanical keyboard in its own right | ✗ Wired                             |
| ✓ Programmable                                          |                                     |
| ✓ Very competitively-priced                             |                                     |

 The [Keychron Q10 Alice 75%](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Swappable-Mechanical-Programmable-Ergonomic/dp/B0BW3W6S3S/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is compact for a mechanical keyboard, with a 75% of full-size design. It uses a split "Alice" layout, and this beauty took our [2023 Editor's Choice](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-best-ranked-5-mobile-backdrop-change-applications-iphone-x78/) as best keyboard over at Review Geek.

 So it should be no surprise that we consider this the best overall ergonomic keyboard. It has everything a modern keyboard fanatic could want. It's mechanical, it has swappable keys, it's programmable, it's built like a tank, and the ergonomics are top-notch thanks to that special key layout.

 You might consider it a downside that this is a wired keyboard. But it's hard to deduct marks for such a design choice, since opting for a wired connection has inherent advantages such as not worrying about batteries or signal drops. Learning to use the Alice layout could be a challenge, but most radical ergonomic keyboards have a learning curve, and the Alice layout is a popular ergonomic layout already.

 The final sticking point could be the price, but the truth is that in the world of proper ergonomic keyboards, where some keyboards can move towards the $500 mark, the Q10 is downright reasonable considering how good it is at the _other_ aspects of being a keyboard beyond ergonomics.

9/ 10 

The Keychron Q10 is both a fantastic mechanical keyboard and ergonomic keyboard. While there's a learning curve with the Alice layout, once you're over that hump it will be hard to go back.

| ✓ Comfortable, quiet, easy to use. |                                                                    |

 The [Logitech K860](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Wrist/dp/B07ZWK2TQT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) looks like it should be a much more expensive keyboard than it is, and that's largely due to Logitech's massive production capacity and experience in computer peripherals. We generally expect a given Logitech peripheral to punch slightly above its weight, but the K860 is notable even for the brand.

 First off, the keyboard is certified by [US Ergonomics,](https://us-ergo.com/product-ergonomics/ergonomics-product-certification/) which makes it an affordable way to ensure everyone in your office at work has an ergonomic typing experience. Logitech has been smart about focusing on features that matter towards this end and leaving out the frills.

 You get a pillowed adjustable palm rest and quiet scooped keys. Combine that with the split key design for the right posture and if pure typing ergonomics is what you want, this is the keyboard to get when value for money is the goal.

 We couldn't find too many complaints, with a few buyers noting that [connectivity could be an issue](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D6XZAUJXIIE9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), though it's worth pointing out that the K860 works with both Bluetooth and Logitech's proprietary Unifying Receivers. The latter is, in our experience, virtually bulletproof, although it does mean giving up one USB port. Not such a bad trade if all of your wireless peripherals are compatible.

 Apart from that potential foible, this keyboard is frugal with the actual keys, and you'll have to do a little function key toggling to switch between the F row and media controls.

[Logitech's ERGO K860](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Wrist/dp/B07ZWK2TQT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a shining star in the world of ergonomic keyboards. While priced a bit higher than other options on our list, it's for a good reason. This ergonomic keyboard boasts ample ergonomic-friendly features, plus it's compatible with a variety of operating systems and devices, including Windows, Mac OS, Chrome OS, and Linux.

 From an ergonomic standpoint, the K860 is impressive. It has a curved, split keyframe design, which is intended to help reduce muscle strain on your wrists and forearms. The split keyboard is fixed so it remains as one unit, but the keys are still designed to fall where your hands naturally sit.

 The pillowed wrist rest contains a memory foam layer that, according to Logitech, offers 54% more wrist support and 25% less wrist bending when compared to your standard keyboard. It also has perfect stroke keys---slightly scooped key designs that match the shape of your fingertips, allowing for more fluid typing.

 There's also an adjustable palm lift that's designed to keep your wrists comfortable and at a natural typing posture. You can switch between 3 options---0, -4, or -7 degrees.

 You can connect up to 3 devices to this keyboard, and the battery life lasts up to 24 months. Just note that while it's compatible with Mac and iPhones, it still requires a USB port for connectivity, so you'll want to ensure you have [one](https://www.amazon.com/SmartQ-Expander-Transfer-Splitter-Compatible/dp/B09PTVSMLB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) before purchasing.

 Otherwise, the K860 is a great buy that contains tons of ergonomic bells and whistles.

 If you're looking for a wireless ergonomic keyboard, the [Perixx Periboard-612](https://www.amazon.com/Perixx-Periboard-612-Ergonomic-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B07TKLB1ML?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a great option. It features a wide palm rest and a split key design that should help your hands rest more naturally. At less than $100, it's a solid bang for your buck.

 Outside of its ergonomic layout, it boasts full Bluetooth connectivity that can be used with either Windows or Mac devices. The default setting is MacOSX; however, there's a switch at the bottom of the keyboard that easily allows you to switch between the operating systems. Just note that you'll need either Windows 10 or MacOSX 10.10 to use this accessory---it's not compatible with Windows 11.

 There are also four switchable keycaps for Mac and Windows that permit you to customize the keyboard to your device of choice.

 Regardless of your operating system, this ergonomic keyboard from Perixx is a solid option, especially if you want to snag one free from wires.

![A Logitech K380 on a desk with a person's hands, one on the keyboard and one on a mouse.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/logitech-k380.jpeg) 

_Logitech_

| Pros                                             | Cons                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✓ One kyboard for Mac and two other devices      | ✗ Round keys can take some getting used to |
| ✓ About the same footprint as Magic Keyboard     | ✗ It does have a slight rattle when typing |
| ✓ Round keys allow for comfortable attack angles |                                            |

 The [Logitech K380](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-K380-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B0148NPH9I/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a keyboard that we frequently use, and it stands toe-to-toe with Apple's [Magic Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-Computers-Silicon/dp/B09BRG3GRR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). While you may not think that small keyboards like these are particularly ergonomic, take it from someone who types 10,000 words a day—these are sleeper workhorses.

 With such a small footprint, the average person can reach every key on the keyboard without moving their wrists. Not only is that efficient, it also helps you keep the right angle, which usually you'd need a split keyboard for. The K380 actually has an advantage over the Magic Keyboard here, since it has round keys that feel the same from any angle you press from.

 Getting used to the round keys is a minor challenge, but once you are used to them, you'll be blasting out reports or essays in comfort. Unfortunately, some of the keys rattle a little, but it's not so loud as to be distracting—it just makes the K380 feel a little cheaper than Apple's keyboard (which it is).

 The battery life is phenomenal, you can add three devices and switch between them at the press of a button, and it's so small you can take it with you. We love the K380 and if you're a Mac or multiplatform user, it's an excellent choice.

 Long-lasting tech accessories can quickly become expensive---but with the [Logitech MK735 bundle](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MK735-Performance-Wireless-Keyboard/dp/B0843MSWR3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you can grab a great ergonomic keyboard and mouse for less than $90.

 The keyboard (which is [Logitech's MK710](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Desktop-MK710-Keyboard/dp/B0037KLSR4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) model) features many comfortable ergonomic features, ranging from the slim design to a cushioned palm rest and curved keys, all of which help your hands sit naturally. Meanwhile, it has an LCD dashboard that easily allows you to check the battery life and whether the Caps, Scroll, or Num Locks are on. When it comes to battery life, the keyboard can last up to 36 months with one set of AA batteries.

 The accompanying mouse (the [Logitech M510](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Computer-Mousepad-Non-Slip/dp/B07S3ZY7T3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU205369&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F816119%2Fbest-ergonomic-keyboard%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)) includes a soft rubber grip and wheels, finger support, high-precision tracking, and seven customizable buttons. This little gadget can even last up to two years before needing to swap the batteries out.

 However, there are some things to consider before you take the plunge. This Logitech combo is only compatible with Windows. If you're looking for a Mac keyboard, the [DELUX GM902](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/decoding-the-latest-in-tech-with-toms-hardware-experts/) is a better option. You also need a free USB port to plug a Bluetooth receiver in---though thankfully it connects to both your keyboard and mouse, so you only need one port.
