##  Shopping For an HDMI Cable in 2023

 The HDMI cable market has gotten fragmented over the years thanks to the [introduction of new standards and technologies](https://www.reviewgeek.com/106583/get-ready-hdmi-is-about-to-get-even-more-complicated/). Some devices require the most modern HDMI spec currently available, while others don't mind if the cable you purchase is worth $10 or $100 due to its more flexible compatibility requirements.

 One of the most important specs you have to keep your eyes out for is [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/). Some modern devices, like Sony's PlayStation 5, require HDMI 2.1 to work properly, mainly due to using some of the best display technologies available.

 These cables tend to be a bit pricier than those that support HDMI 2.0 or lower, but that, unfortunately, comes with having the latest and greatest tech. Upgrading to an HDMI 2.1 cable now, however, can future-proof your set ups for any devices you may get down the line, simplifying matters.

 It's also important to pay attention to display standards, resolutions, and sound output. If your monitor or TV is equipped with an 8K resolution and HDR support, it's best to double-check the cable you're about to buy to ensure both of those specs are supported.

 This also goes for special specifications like [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) and fast refresh rates. You'll also want to ensure the cable works with your sound system, whether based on [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) or [DTS:X](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ace-windows-10-tricks-to-save-time-and-energy/).

 Of course, everyone will have their own needs and budget for finding a new HDMI cable, so to make the search easier and less tedious, we've rounded up six of the best cables for a variety of users.

##  Best HDMI Cable Overall: [Belkin Ultra HD HDMI 2.1 Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-AV10176bt2M-BLK-Ultra-Speed-Cable/dp/B07GVVJPLM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                              | Cons                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ✓ 8K 60Hz output                  | ✗ Costly for a cable |
| ✓ Braided design                  |                      |
| ✓ Premium high speed materials    |                      |
| ✓ Compatible with gaming consoles |                      |

 The best HDMI cable needs to check a few boxes: it has to be reliable, durable, easy to maneuver, and it needs to support modern data transfer speeds. [Belkin's Ultra HD HDMI 2.1 Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-AV10176bt2M-BLK-Ultra-Speed-Cable/dp/B07GVVJPLM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has everything covered.

 Its braided cable is a cut above the typical heat shrink tubing you'll find on more affordable options, mainly because it stands up to significantly more wear and tear. You won't have to worry about frayed wires or a cord that gives up on you at the drop of a hat, and reliability is a price worth paying for.

 And if you're worried about data transfer speeds, don't be. The Belkin HDMI 2.1 Cable can support 8K resolutions at 60Hz speeds (or 4K at 120Hz for a smooth gaming and home theater experience) since it clocks in at 48Gbps.

 Braided cables tend to have one unique drawback compared to heat shrink tubing alternatives---they can be stiff as a board. Fortunately, Belkin recognized this and, instead of a thick, unwieldy cord, created a cable that's easy to maneuver and fit into tight spaces (think between your TV and the wall).

 At 6.6ft (2.01m), the Belkin Ultra HD HDMI 2.1 Cable can span most setups, but you may want to opt for something a little longer if you're big into clean cable management or you're running the cord across the length of a room.

 Otherwise, Belkin's Ultra HD HDMI cable will fit right in with your setup and stick around for years to come.

Best HDMI Cable Overall

#####  Belkin Ultra HD HDMI 2.1 Cable

$60 $64 Save $4 

With 8K 60Hz output capabilities and a durable braided design, Belkin's HDMI cable is the perfect fit for almost any setup.

[$60 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-AV10176bt2M-BLK-Ultra-Speed-Cable/dp/B07GVVJPLM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                         | Cons             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ✓ 4K support                 | ✗ No HDR support |
| ✓ Affordable                 | ✗ HDMI 2.0       |
| |  ✗ Not designed for gaming |                  |

 If your budget is particularly tight and you still need a reliable HDMI cable, Amazon sells [a less expensive model](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-1-Pack/dp/B014I8SSD0?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) of our overall pick at just $7 for six feet.

 The cable provides all the necessary specs for compatibility with most modern devices, although it isn't HDMI 2.1 compatible. It also lacks HDR support and comes with a rubber exterior instead of a braided one.

 Still, this cable should do the trick for most people thanks to its 4K support, 18Gbps bandwidth, and Ethernet support. While not the most robust cable you can purchase, it's by no means a slouch.

| Pros                                       | Cons            |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| ✓ 8K HDR support                           | ✗ Chunky design |
| ✓ 4K @ 120Hz                               |                 |

| ✓ Braided cable                            |                 |

 With [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) devices becoming more and more common, it's a good idea to add an HDMI 2.1 cable to your collection, and we recommend [Monoprice's 8K certified braided cable](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Certified-Braided-Ultra-Speed/dp/B08X6X5FC3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for doing just that. Its premium design means you won't have to worry about fraying over time, and its HDMI 2.1 support means you'll be able to connect to devices that require more bandwidth at up to 48Gbps.

 The cable supports [Dynamic HDR](https://win-able.techidaily.com/defeating-pc-launch-obstacles-in-days-gone-a-step-by-step-troubleshooting-guide/), [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/), [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and [DTS:X](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ace-windows-10-tricks-to-save-time-and-energy/) surround sound. Meanwhile, you can output to a display with up to an 8K resolution at 60Hz, as well as 4K at 120Hz.

 This cable's only downside is its somewhat robust, inflexible design. If you don't have a lot of room for a somewhat chunky HDMI connector on your devices, this model might not be for you. For everyone else, though, you won't be disappointed.

 Jumping into the 8K content landscape? Consider picking up [this 8K HDMI cable from Cable Matters](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-300032-WHT-5m-HDMI/dp/B08B2LH662?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It comes with a braided design for durability with black or white color options. Sizes range from 3.3 feet to 16.4 feet.

 Of course, what counts are the specs. This HDMI 2.1 cable comes with 8K output at up to 120Hz, granting compatibility with some of the most cutting-edge displays on the market. It also includes [4:4:4 RGB HDR](https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-motorola-moto-g-5g-2023-to-other-android-devices-using-bluetooth-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), Dolby Vision, and 12-bit color.

 On the audio front, you'll find Dolby Atmos 7.1 and DTS:X 5.1 surround sound support, as well as HDMI eARC. You'll also get 48Gbps of bandwidth to power even the most complex of entertainment setups.

 The ends of the cable remain the only real downfall as they're noticeably thick, so ensure you have enough space on your device if you purchase it.

 When it comes to gamers, support for the latest specifications is always a must in the HDMI world. This is especially true now because of [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/)—a new standard that supports the latest entertainment technologies. The PlayStation 5 requires HDMI 2.1 for full functionality, so it's important that your HDMI cable can support it.

 If you need a new HDMI cable to complete your setup, consider grabbing [Zeskit's Maya 8K cable](https://www.amazon.com/48Gbps-Compatible-Netflix-Playstation-Samsung/dp/B07S1CGQ9Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Being HDMI 2.1 certified, the Maya cable will work like a charm for most modern gaming consoles like the PS5, while being backward compatible with older devices.

 It supports 48Gbps bandwidth, which enables 4K output at 120Hz and 8K at 60Hz. Dynamic HDR support, Dolby Vision, [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), and DTS:X compatibility are all included, and its unique copper conductors ensure a stable connection with reduced [judder](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fixing-video-editing-software-failures-after-effects-stability-on-windows-11-and-10/) during gameplay.

 Externally, the cable sports a durable braided finish with reinforced edges to reduce fraying. It only ships in one color, and you'll need to be okay a maximum of 10 feet in length. So long as these are non-issues, the Zeskit Maya 8K HDMI cable should suit your setup well.

 If your home entertainment setup is challenging for cable management, it might suit you to pick up an HDMI cable with an angled connector. [This model from UGREEN](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Ethernet-Compatible-Nintendo-Playstation/dp/B00QV6Y19S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207241&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F780235%2Fbest-hdmi-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers a standard flat connector on one end and a 90-degree connection on the other, helping you run the cable against a flat surface in case space is an issue.

 It also boasts notable specs such as 4K support, 48-bit deep color, and improved shielding to ensure a stable connection.

 Unfortunately, this cable won't have anything fancy, such as HDR support, surround sound, or fast refresh rates. So long as you can live with that, this cable can be a lifesaver for those with an unorthodox home theater or office configuration.
