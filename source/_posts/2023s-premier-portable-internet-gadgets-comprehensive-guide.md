##  What to Look For in a Mobile Hotspot in 2023

 Pretty much every smartphone can act as a [mobile hotspot](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-tecno-camon-20-premier-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) these days, sharing your phone's data connection with nearby devices. It's good enough for occasional use, but if you travel a lot and need reliable connectivity, dedicated mobile hotspots, also known as MiFi devices, are a better option.

 Fortunately, there are quite a few mobile hotspot options in the market. However, you need to keep a few things in mind if you want the best mobile hotspot.

 You will primarily find [4G](https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/ace-your-playtime-with-2024s-must-have-console-picks/) and [5G](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-free-top-6-best-apps-to-remove-objects-from-photo-on-iphone/) mobile hotspots in the market. While 5G hotspots will undoubtedly provide faster internet access, they are considerably more expensive. Also, since carriers are still building their 5G networks, you might not get 5G coverage everywhere.

 On the other hand, 4G MiFi devices are cheaper and with better coverage, but they don't offer high-speed connectivity. You'll need to decide if coverage or speed is more important for your needs.

 Another critical feature to keep an eye out for is battery life. You'll likely want a MiFi device that can at least last through a workday, so one that runs out of juice in a few hours is not the best. In addition, fast charging support and the hotspot's ability to act as a power bank are good to have.

 Wi-Fi flexibility is also important. The best mobile hotspots support [Wi-Fi 6](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-detailed-guidance-how-to-change-or-customize-your-ringtone-on-an-iphone/) to provide better performance and longer battery life. If the MiFi device that you are picking doesn't have Wi-Fi 6, ensure that it at least supports Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and [dual-band Wi-Fi](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-android-without-a-wire-heres-your-free-games-list-for-2024/).

 Apart from all this, a touchscreen display will provide easier access to connection details and device settings. Lastly, if you plan to use the MiFi device abroad, ensure it supports the necessary bands to function in the country that you are visiting.

##  Best Unlocked Mobile Hotspot: [Netgear Nighthawk M6 MR6150](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-Mobile-Hotspot-MR6150/dp/B0BGV79FHT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206276&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797599%2Fbest-mobile-hotspot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Brand) 

![Netgear Nighthawk M6 on table outside](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-M6-1.jpg) 

Netgear

| Pros                                                           | Cons         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Sub-6GHz and C-band 5G support                                 | No mmWave 5G |
| Up to 13-hour battery life and supports battery-less operation | Expensive    |
| Wi-Fi 6 support                                                |              |
| Touchscreen display                                            |              |

 The [Netgear Nighthawk M6](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-Mobile-Hotspot-MR6150/dp/B0BGV79FHT/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206276&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797599%2Fbest-mobile-hotspot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Brand), the successor to our previous pick for this category, is the best unlocked mobile hotspot for most people. Although Netgear says it works best with AT&T and T-Mobile in the US, this multi-carrier hotspot has the necessary frequency band support to operate with most carriers in and out of the country.

 One of the biggest reasons to consider the M6 is 5G support. The Netgear mobile hotspot is compatible with sub-6GHz 5G, including the newer [C-band](https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/simple-tricks-to-determine-the-precise-model-number-of-your-macbook-device/) frequencies. So you not only get faster internet speeds at 5G locations, but you are also future-proof.

[mmWave 5G](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-flip-to-fun-converting-youtube-videos-to-playful-download-free-gifs-for-2024/) support is missing, but it's not a significant omission, as it is only available in very few urban locations. In addition, the MiFi device can use 4G LTE networks as a fallback where 5G is not present.

 Among other features, the hotspot supports Wi-Fi 6, making it better at dealing with multiple connected devices and offering a faster data transfer rate than Wi-Fi 5 hotspots. In addition, you can connect up to 32 devices, which is more than enough for regular consumers and even small businesses.

 You also get a Gigabit [Ethernet port](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-extract-and-save-fb-videos-the-cutting-edge-of-top-5/) for wired connectivity, a 2.4-inch touchscreen display to interact with the device, and two TS-9 ports for external antennae.

 The 5,040mAh removable battery of the Netgear Nighthawk M6 is big enough to last for up to 13 hours on a single charge, depending on your usage. If you need to use it for longer, you can directly plug in the power adapter and remove the battery. The company also sells [add-on batteries for M6](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-Lithium-Replacement-Battery/dp/B098FGJHHQ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206276&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797599%2Fbest-mobile-hotspot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Brand).

 But all these features come at a cost, and you will have to shell out a lot of money for the M6\. If that is too much and you can do without 5G, Netgear offers a solid 4G mobile hotspot in the [Nighthawk M1](https://www.amazon.com/Netgear-Nighthawk-MR1100-GSM-Unlocked/dp/B07G5KWZ3H/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206276&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797599%2Fbest-mobile-hotspot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Brand). However, it only supports [Wi-Fi 5](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-spotify-location-after-moving-to-another-country-on-vivo-s17-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and up to 20 devices.

| Pros                               | Cons                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| Small form factor                  | Unlimited plans have a FUP limit |

 The [Solis Lite](https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Coverage-Connected-Devices-Technology/dp/B08YKB6VMN/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206276&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797599%2Fbest-mobile-hotspot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Brand) is a no-frills mobile hotspot that can connect you to the internet in [over 130 countries worldwide](https://soliswifi.co/pages/global-coverage). If you are planning a vacation or going on a work trip to another country and don't want to be dependent on your phone for tethering, the Solis Lite is a great choice—which is why we gave it an Editor's Choice award in our [Solis Lite review](https://win-able.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-steps-to-prevent-r-type-final-grogsyndicationerror)r-type-final-2-from-crashing-on-your-computer/):

> The Solis Lite Wi-Fi Hotspot is compact and easy to carry around and doesn't need any SIM cards to work. Whether you are traveling for work or leisure, this device is an excellent solution for staying connected to the internet without having to rely on public Wi-Fi networks or expensive data plans.

 This mobile hotspot supports 4G and 3G mobile networks and has Wi-Fi 5 ([802.11ac](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-thorough-analysis-for-easy-dynamic-range-photography/)) connectivity. In addition, the device packs a 4,700mAh battery that can last up to 16 hours on a single charge and act as a power bank when needed. It doesn't offer the fastest data speeds, and the network connectivity could be better. However, it's an excellent option for budget-conscious travelers who need to stay connected.

 This mobile hotspot uses a virtual SIM that connects to the company's partner cellular providers wherever you are. All you need is a data plan that you can purchase from the company. There are pay-per-GB and [unlimited data plans](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-honor-magic-v2-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/).

 However, the unlimited plans come with a [fair usage policy (FUP) limit](https://support.skyroam.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033217174-Fair-Use-Policy), after which the internet speed drops to just 512kbps, which is barely functional. This makes the Solis Lite perfect for short-term, occasional use. However, if you need something with a better data limit, you might be better served with an alternate arrangement in the country you're traveling to.

##  Best Verizon Mobile Hotspot: [Orbic Speed 5G UW](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206276/https://www.verizon.com/internet-devices/orbic-speed-5g-uw/) 

![orbic hotspot on green and blue background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orbic.jpg) 

Orbic

| Pros                                           | Cons                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 5G support, including mmWave and C-band        | Battery life can be better |
| Built-in touchscreen display and Ethernet port |                            |

 If you need a mobile hotspot that works great on Verizon, there is no better option than the [Orbic Speed 5G UW](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206276/https://www.verizon.com/internet-devices/orbic-speed-5g-uw/). It not only supports Verizon's mmWave 5G network, but it can also work with the newer [C-band](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206276/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/what-is-c-band) deployment, meaning you'll get faster 5G connectivity in more places. Support for 5G nationwide, low-band 5G, and 4G LTE is also present.

 You can connect up to 30 devices to the Orbic Speed 5G, and it supports Wi-Fi 6 for better wireless performance if you have compatible devices. In addition, there is a 4,400mAh battery that lasts about nine hours on a single charge. Orbic has also included [Quick Charge fast charging](https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/stream-free-how-to-view-roku-shows-on-alternative-platforms/) support, so you'll be able to top it up quickly when the device finally runs out of juice.

 In other features, there is a 2.4-inch touchscreen display on the mobile hotspot to access basic functions or to glance at the connection status.

 However, if you don't necessarily care about 5G or plan to use the Wi-Fi hotspot at a location where 5G coverage is spotty or missing, Verizon's [Jetpack MiFi 8800L](https://www.amazon.com/Verizon-Jetpack-Hotspot-WiFi-Device/dp/B09LYMZ49Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206276&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F797599%2Fbest-mobile-hotspot%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Brand) is an excellent alternative. It supports 4G LTE Advanced and provides fast performance and good battery life.

It packs everything you need for super-fast connectivity on the go. You get access to the carrier's impressive mid-band 5G coverage, and there is 4G LTE and 3G support when there is no 5G.

 The Mi-Fi device also comes with Wi-Fi 6 support, and you can connect up to 32 devices. Plus, Wi-Fi 6 and 5G make the MiFi X Pro future-proof. So you won't need to upgrade for a while.

 The onboard 5,050mAh battery is good enough to last a workday, and you can also use the hotspot as a power bank for your phone in a crunch situation. In other highlights, the 2.4-inch LCD allows you to access the basic device settings quickly. But if you need more granular control, there is a web interface.

 Lastly, there is a single Gigabit Ethernet port for wired connectivity to your computer or another device that needs low-latency internet.

 The [Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206276/https://www.att.com/buy/connected-devices-and-more/netgear-nighthawk-m6-pro.html) is the best mobile hotspot in AT&T’s portfolio. It packs cutting-edge technologies, including support for the carrier’s C-band and mmWave 5G networks. So you can access the best of AT&T’s 5G offerings. 

 But fast 5G needs fast Wi-Fi and Ethernet to get the most out of it. And for that very purpose, Netgear has included [Wi-Fi 6E](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-top-20-gags-and-laughter-on-youtube-for-downtime-delight/) connectivity and a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port. Wi-Fi 6E will deliver superior network performance and is excellent at dealing with multiple simultaneous connections. The 2.5G Ethernet port will be helpful when you want a low-latency wired connection. For an even faster, wired connection, you can use the built-in USB-C port that supports data transfer rates of up to 5Gbps.

 In other highlights, there is a removable 5,040mAh battery that AT&T claims can last up to nine hours of active usage. It also supports fast charging. You can remove the battery and use power through the included wall adapter if you want. This not only eliminates the need to charge the battery but also boosts the wireless coverage area.

 You also get a 2.8-inch color touchscreen to monitor the network status and access the device settings.

 Unfortunately, all these exciting and helpful features add up, making the Nighthawk M6 Pro a bit expensive. If you want something a bit cheaper, you can consider the [Nighthawk M6](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206276/https://www.att.com/buy/connected-devices-and-more/netgear-nighthawk-m6.html), which lacks mmWave 5G and Wi-Fi 6 support. But it’s becoming harder to find.

## FAQ

### What are mobile hotspots?

 A [mobile hotspot](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimal-storage-solutions-the-leading-10-gopro-housings/) is a portable wireless access point that uses a cellular data connection to deliver wireless internet to nearby devices. It can be a dedicated piece of hardware or [software on your smartphone](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/a-filmmakers-approach-to-classroom-instructional-videos-for-2024/).

### Can I use a mobile hotspot as a replacement for home internet?

 It's possible to use a mobile hotspot to replace wired home internet. However, hotspot plans are typically more expensive than home broadband plans and have lower data caps. 

### Can I use a mobile hotspot without using data?

 While it's technically possible to use a mobile hotspot without a data connection, you won't be able to do much as there won't be internet connectivity. If you're thinking of connecting to a [wireless network](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-prelude-to-cinematic-dialogue/) instead of your carrier's cellular data connection, you can connect your device directly to the Wi-Fi network.

### How do I connect a mobile hotspot to my computer?

 You can connect to a mobile hotspot like you would connect to any Wi-Fi network. All you have to do is switch on the hotspot and look for its SSID in your computer's Wi-Fi settings. And then, select that SSID and enter the network password. 

### How do I connect a mobile hotspot to my smart TV?

 Once your mobile hotspot is switched on, it'll appear as a Wi-Fi network in your smart TV's network settings. Select your hotspot's wireless SSID and enter the password, and your smart TV will be connected to the wireless hotspot.
