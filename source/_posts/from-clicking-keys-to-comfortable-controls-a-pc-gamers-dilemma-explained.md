 I love gaming on my PC because there’s a wider selection of games, and I have a desktop that is more powerful than any console on the market. Despite this, I exclusively play games using a controller and avoid using my keyboard and mouse. That may sound blasphemous, but I have some good reasoning.

## 1  The Pinky Problem

 I remember the days when my fingers could dance on the keyboard like a virtuoso pianist, pinky poised over Ctrl, thumb on the Space bar, the rest gliding effortlessly. If I try to do that now, I’ll end up with an aching pinky or a cramped forearm.

 As I've entered my 30s, ergonomics has become increasingly crucial. Sure, you can remap keys to a more comfortable layout, but you're still navigating a flat surface that demands ambitious finger gymnastics.

 It's not just keyboards, either. Constant mouse movements can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, a [common ailment among pro gamers](https://esportshealthcare.com/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/). While I'm not that hardcore, why risk my health for a hobby?

 Controllers offer a more ergonomic alternative. Your fingers wrap naturally around them, moving freely, especially the [Xbox Elite controllers](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/the-rise-and-challenges-of-video-streaming-profits/) and their [game-changing back buttons](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/the-best-ai-naming-assistants-for-podcast-innovation-for-2024/).

## 2  Controllers Are Better for My Preferred Game Genres

 Keyboard and mouse are the go-to for FPS and RTS enthusiasts, but those aren't my jam. I'm more into action RPGs, 2D and 3D platformers, _EA Sports FC_, and twin-stick shooters. For these genres, I find a gamepad is often the superior choice.

 Many of the games in these genres are designed with consoles in mind, where controllers are the default input. As a result, the controls are optimized for gamepads, offering me a smoother, more intuitive experience.

 Don't get me wrong, I've spent countless hours enjoying RTS games like _Warcraft 3_ and _Starcraft 2_ with a keyboard and mouse. I understand their strengths for certain genres. However, with the decline of RTS games and my waning interest in FPS titles, I find controllers better suited for the types of games I enjoy most these days.

## 3  A Poor Choice for Emulation 

 While I'm not the greatest fan of [emulators](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-podcasters-handbook-writing-strategies-and-sample-scripts-available-free/), I know many who are and they unanimously vote against the use of keyboards and mice for emulated games.

 It makes sense when you think about it. When emulating a game, you're recreating an experience originally designed for specific input devices, namely gamepads. It's only logical that using a controller would offer the most authentic and enjoyable experience.

 If you're interested in emulation, there are various [gamepads better suited for different types of emulated systems](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-apple-id-verification-code-not-working-from-iphone-12-pro-by-drfone-ios/). That said, most emulators allow you to remap buttons, so you can adapt a single gamepad to mimic different controller layouts.

## 4  A Lack of Vibration Feedback 

 Let's talk about something that keyboard and mouse setups sorely lack: [vibration feedback](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-error-12-failed-to-detect-location-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). If your keyboard or mouse is vibrating, you might want to get that checked out. And if it's battery-powered and vibrating, maybe step away slowly—we don't want any surprise fireworks!

 Jokes aside, the vibration feedback on a gamepad adds a whole new dimension to gaming. It's not just about seeing and hearing; it's about _feeling_ the game.

 Take _FIFA_, for instance. When I score a goal, and the controller vibrates, it amplifies the excitement of that moment. Or when I'm web-slinging through New York City as Spider-Man, the subtle vibrations as I swing and gain momentum make me feel like I'm really there, soaring between skyscrapers.

 This is to say nothing of the modern haptic feedback seen on the PS5 DualSense controller with its adaptive triggers, and the rumble feedback that Xbox Core controllers feature in the triggers.

## 5  Not Ideal for Local Co-op or PvP 

![illustration of two people awkwardly trying to share a single keyboard and mouse setup for gaming.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/illustration-of-two-people-awkwardly-trying-to-share-a-single-keyboard-and-mouse-setup-for-gaming.png)

 As a fan of hosting gaming sessions, I've found keyboard and mouse setups to be a real party pooper for [local co-op](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-earnings-expertise-for-youtube-creators-fb-insights-and-tactics/) or PvP. I mean, how do you even make that work?

 You can't have two people sharing one keyboard and mouse. So, inevitably, one person gets the keyboard and mouse while the other uses a gamepad. Boom! Instant uneven playing field.

 Then there's the logistical nightmare. If I'm on a keyboard and mouse, I need to be right in front of my PC. So where does my friend sit? Beside me, they're looking at the screen at an awkward angle. Behind me, they're basically watching the back of my head instead of the game. Granted, I have great hair, but that’s not the point.

 I've experienced this first-hand with _EA Sports FC 24_, my current go-to game for local multiplayer. But it translates to other titles like _Street Fighter_, _It Takes Two_, or _Overcooked_. Trust me, you don't want to play _Overcooked_ with one person on a gamepad and another fumbling with a keyboard.

## 6  I’m Tied to My Desk 

 Picture this: I've spent hours sitting at my desk, working away. When it's finally time to unwind with some games, I'm faced with the prospect of either staying in that exact same spot or going somewhere else. My life can’t start and end at a desk.

 What I really want is the freedom to scoot over to my comfy beanbag or sprawl out on the sofa and play my games, like [that afforded by a handheld like the Steam Deck](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-performers-playbook-avoiding-common-mistakes-in-ppt-voiceovers/). But with a keyboard and mouse setup, that's just not an option. Playing games while balancing a keyboard on your knees and a mouse in front of the sofa doesn't sound like a great time.

 This is the main reason I decided to get a gamepad. I can easily grab my controller, plop down anywhere in my room, and start gaming.

## 7  Breaks My Work Discipline 

 Most of us don't have a gaming PC _and_ an office PC, all we have is a PC. On this system, we do our work and we play our games, which is just a recipe for procrastination. I can't count how many times I jumped into a gaming session because I had to do some work that was boring or tiring. I thought a quick gaming session would clear my mind, but all it did was tick away an hour or two of the workday.

 I'm not blaming the keyboard and mouse entirely, though it did seem like the call of a siren sometimes. However, after switching to a gamepad for gaming (and gradually preferring it over a keyboard and mouse), I noticed a boost in my productivity.

 By associating gaming with a gamepad and keeping it out of sight during work hours, I created just enough friction to resist sneaking into quick gaming sessions when work got challenging. I established a clear boundary: work mode is a keyboard and mouse, and play mode is a gamepad. It's simple, effective, and [keeps me disciplined](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/the-insiders-guide-to-captivating-youtube-headlines/).

## 8  Because I Love My Keyboard and Mouse

 This is not as contradictory as it sounds. I cherish my keyboard and mouse for work, which is precisely why I avoid using them for gaming. They're essential tools for my livelihood, and I'd rather keep them safe from the rigors of intense gaming sessions.

 I've lost keyboards to button-mashing in action-packed games. Even [switching to mechanical keyboards](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/social-sensation-best-insta-stories-effects/) didn't solve the issue entirely. Imagine trying to write an article when _thespacebarstopsworking_. Frustrating, right? Even my mouse's left-click got a bit mushy and unresponsive.

 My [current mechanical keyboard has hot-swappable](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/streamlining-visual-storytelling-with-youtube-videos-for-2024/) switches, so technically, if a key falters, I can pull it out and replace it. However, considering this and all the above points, it’s just more convenient to have a dedicated gamepad for gaming while preserving my keyboard and mouse for work.

## 9  A Spare Keyboard and Mouse Will Take Up Too Much Desk Space 

 Before you write in the comments, “Dude, just use a separate keyboard and mouse for gaming,” well, I tried that. My first attempt was to install a keyboard tray under my desk. It didn't work out—the tray restricted leg movement, which is a no-go for someone with [restless leg syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377168).

 I even considered a [compact, one-handed gaming keyboard](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-innovative-question-collection-for-lively-podcast-discussions/) and a separate mouse, but desk space is precious. I need room for notebooks, pens, and other essentials. Cramming two sets of peripherals in wasn't worth it compared to the simplicity of a gamepad.

 That said, those one-handed keyboards are actually really cool and might work well for those who primarily use their PC for gaming and want that classic gamer aesthetic. I can see myself using it if I played RTS or FPS games and had an even wider desk for all my other stuff.

 For many PC gamers, ditching the keyboard and mouse for a controller is like trading in your sports car for a simple sedan. But sometimes, the comfort and ergonomics of a sedan are exactly what you need.

 Sure, I won’t be topping any leaderboards in _Valorant_ or micromanaging armies in _Starcraft_ using a controller, but I'm having a blast playing my favorite games from the comfort of my couch without the fear of carpal tunnel or a busted Space bar.
