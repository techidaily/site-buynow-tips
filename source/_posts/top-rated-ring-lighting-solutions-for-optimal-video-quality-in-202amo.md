##  What to Look For in a Ring Light

 The first thing to consider is the purpose for which you need a ring light. Is it for selfies, streaming, product macros, or online meetings? Depending on your requirement, you'll have to account for the size of the ring light, colors and temperature, and other factors.

 Size also matters, as ring lights come in different sizes (diameters) for different purposes. These sizes can range from massive, that have room to house a large DSLR camera, to small options that you can attach to the top of a laptop or PC monitor.

 The brightness is also key. There are different brightness levels to consider, depending on whether you're using a ring light for product photography or just for better lighting during a video call. Equally important is the color temperature. This determines the lighting tone, i.e. how warm or cool its color output gets. Typically, the wider the range, the more you can experiment with how to light a scene.

 Other essential factors include the color rendering index (CRI), which is a measure of how natural colors render under an artificial white light source compared to sunlight. Depending on your needs, also important are the power source, portability, ease of setup, and more.

 In this roundup, we’ve included ring lights that take these factors into consideration, with options included for every budget.

## FAQ

### Where is the best place to set up a ring light?

 The best place to set up a ring light varies depending on the specific situation and the lighting effect you hope to achieve. For instance, a clip-on ring light is best placed above the webcam on your computer facing you. However, this arrangement will not work for other scenarios and ring light sizes. In general, you can find out the best place to set up a ring light by experimenting with different angles and distances.

### Is a 10-inch or 12-inch ring light better?

 The answer is relative. It depends on the specific situation and lighting effect you hope to achieve. For instance, a 10-inch ring light may suffice for close-up photographs or product macros, but may fall short for extreme long shot or extreme wide shot photography.

### What is CRI?

 CRI stands for Color Rendering Index. It measures how much natural colors render under an artificial white light source compared to under sunlight. In other words, it measures how well artificial light sources render colors compared to natural light sources. CRI is represented as a numerical value on a scale of 0 to 100, with the higher, the better.
