## Display and Size: The S24 Ultra Is Bigger and Brighter

 iPhone 15 Pro Max

* 6.7-inch display; 1290 x 2796 resolution.
* 120Hz; 2000 nits peak brightness.
* 6.30 x 3.02 x 0.33; 221 grams.
* LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED.

 Samsung S24 Ultra

* 6.8-inch display; 1440 x 3120 resolution.
* 120Hz; 2600 nits peak brightness.
* 6.39 x 3.11 x 0.34 in; 232 grams.
* Dynamic LTPO AMOLED.

 The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is slightly larger overall. Its screen is a bit bigger and the phone takes up a little more space in your pocket. However, these differences are minimal and hardly noticeable.

 One difference that might matter to you is the display quality. While the Galaxy S24 Ultra boasts a higher pixel density for sharper visuals (about 11 percent more pixels per inch), the iPhone 15 Pro Max prioritizes color accuracy with its Super Retina XDR display with[OLED](https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091) .

 The iPhone might not have the most pixels per inch, but the colors it displays will be incredibly close to what the creator intended, ideal for tasks like photo editing or graphic design.

## Cameras: The iPhone Has Cinematic Mode

 iPhone 15 Pro Max

* Main: 48MP wide / 12MP periscope telephoto / 12 MP ultrawide / 12MP selfie.
* Video: HDR / 4K up to 60fps / 1080p up to 120fps / Dolby Vision HDR (up to 60fps), ProRes.
* Cinematic mode lets you record while blurring the foreground and background.

 Samsung S24 Ultra

* Main: 200MP wide / 10MP telephoto / 50MP periscope telephoto / 12MP ultrawide / 12MP selfie.
* Video: Auto-HDR, HDR10+ / 8K up to 30fps / 4K up to 120fps / 1080p up to 240fps.
* Dual Recording lets you use the rear and selfie camera simultaneously.

 The camera systems on these phones take very different approaches. The Galaxy S24 Ultra has a monstrous 200MP main sensor, dwarfing the iPhone 15 Pro Max's 48MP offering. However, there's a catch: The S24 Ultra typically outputs 12MP photos by default, combining pixels for better low-light performance. The iPhone might capture slightly more detail in perfect lighting, but the S24 Ultra could shine in dim environments.

 The zoom capabilities also differ. The iPhone features a dedicated 5x optical zoom lens, ideal for getting closer to distant subjects without losing quality. The S24 Ultra relies on a combination of its main sensor and a 5x telephoto lens and adds a 3x telephoto lens for a more versatile mid-range zoom option that the iPhone lacks.

 Each phone also features a unique video mode. The iPhone 15 Pro Max's Cinematic mode is all about artistic control, using AI to create a shallow depth-of-field effect that mimics high-end cameras; it's great for a polished, cinematic look. Samsung's Dual Recording mode focuses on capturing two perspectives at once. It's ideal for vloggers or anyone who wants to record themselves and the scene at the same time.

 The best camera for you depends on your priorities. If you crave the most detail and zoom power, and Cinematic mode sounds like something you'd enjoy, the iPhone might be the better choice. But if shooting[8K video](https://www.lifewire.com/8k-resolution-beyond-4k-1846844) and having a variety of zoom options is more important, the S24 Ultra could be a better fit.

## Performance and Battery: It's Hard to Tell the Difference

 iPhone 15 Pro Max

* Apple A17 Pro chipset.
* Wired and wireless charging.
* 4,441mAh battery.

 Samsung S24 Ultra

* Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset.
* Wired and wireless charging.
* 5,000mAh battery.

 Both the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra are performance beasts. Apple equips the iPhone with the A17 Pro chip. Samsung counters with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which could offer a slight edge in raw multi-tasking power due to its 12 GB of RAM compared to the iPhone's 8 GB.

 However, real-world performance differences between these processors are often negligible for everyday tasks. Where the iPhone might shine is in its software optimization. Apple tightly controls both hardware and software, leading to a smooth and efficient user experience.

 Battery life is another close call. The S24 Ultra boasts a larger 5,000mAh battery compared to the iPhone's 4,441mAh. In theory, this could translate to longer endurance on the S24 Ultra.

 However, Apple's iPhones are known for their excellent software optimization, which can significantly improve battery efficiency. Also, the iPhone's display, while beautiful, might use slightly less power than the S24 Ultra's high-resolution panel.

 Ultimately, real-world battery life will depend on individual usage patterns. Both phones will likely offer a full day's charge for most users, with the S24 Ultra potentially lasting a bit longer for heavy users.

 The deciding factor here might be charging speed. Samsung advertises the S24 Ultra as being able to hit 65 percent after just half an hour, and the iPhone isn't far behind, reaching 50 percent in the same amount of time. If you frequently need a power boost, you can't go wrong with either phone.

## Software and Features: iOS and Android Have Their Unique Advantages

 iPhone 15 Pro Max

* Runs iOS.
* Customizable Action button.
* Simple and user-friendly, but little room for deep customization.
* Known for its robust security measures.
* Emergency SOS via satellite to reach emergency services without normal coverage.

 Samsung S24 Ultra

* Runs Android.
* Built-in S Pen.
* Steeper learning curve for some users, but adaptable to your preferences.
* More susceptible to malware due to the availability of apps from multiple sources.
* Samsung DeX for desktop mode on a TV.

 The software battleground between iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fight between familiarity and flexibility.

[Apple's iOS](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355) offers a polished, user-friendly experience with a focus on simplicity and tight integration between hardware and software. Features like the new[Action button on the iPhone](https://www.lifewire.com/ways-to-use-iphone-action-button-8346805) allow for handy, quick access to everyday functions like launching an app or Shortcut, or triggering the flashlight or camera.

 Samsung's One UI, built on[Android](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887) , provides a more customizable experience. Power users will appreciate the ability to tweak the interface and features to their liking. The Galaxy S24 Ultra takes advantage of this with the S Pen stylus, letting you do loads of things, like take notes, draw, write a perfect signature, translate, and interact with the phone in a precise way.

 Another huge difference between iOS and Android is security.[Apple’s closed ecosystem reduces the risk of viruses](https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-iphone-is-more-secure-than-android-2000308) and apps undergo strict review processes before being available on the App Store.

 Android's flexible nature means more opportunities for malicious apps to get onto the phone. Meanwhile, iOS supports end-to-end encryption for iMessages and FaceTime, and Android on the Galaxy S24 Ultra includes features like fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and secure folders to bolster security.

## Ecosystem: Your In-Kind Tech Just Works

 iPhone 15 Pro Max

* Easy to set up Apple-branded watches, laptops, earbuds, etc.

 Samsung S24 Ultra

* Easy to set up Samsung Galaxy products.

 The iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra aren't just phones; they're gateways to their respective ecosystems.

 If you already own an Apple Watch, AirPods, Mac, HomePods, or other Apple devices, the iPhone 15 Pro Max integrates seamlessly. Features like AirDrop and Handoff make sharing files and data a breeze. And iMessage keeps you connected to fellow Apple users[with unique features](https://www.lifewire.com/imessage-apples-free-texting-app-1999185) .

 The Galaxy S24 Ultra shines in a Samsung ecosystem. It pairs easily with Galaxy Buds, Galaxy Watch, and Samsung laptops for effortless file transfer and cross-device functionality.[Samsung's SmartThings app](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-samsung-smartthings-app-5104981) lets you control your smart home from your phone, potentially offering deeper integration with compatible Samsung appliances.

 Both ecosystems offer advantages, so consider your existing tech stack. If you're heavily invested in one brand, the corresponding phone will offer a smoother and more familiar experience. But if you're brand agnostic, you can pick the ecosystem that best suits your needs.

## Price: You'll Save Money With the iPhone, but Not a Lot

 iPhone 15 Pro Max

* $1,199 for 256 GB.
* $1,399 for 512 GB.
* $1,599 for 1 TB.
* Extra protection starts at $200.

 Samsung S24 Ultra

* $1,299 for 256 GB.
* $1,419 for 512 GB.
* $1,659 for 1 TB.
* Extra protection starts at $259.

 These phones come with a hefty price tag, no doubt about it. However, if budget is a concern, the iPhone 15 Pro Max offers a (slightly) more affordable option.

 Both the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra come in three storage sizes, with the iPhone being slightly cheaper for each model. Additionally, opting for a 2-year AppleCare+ subscription will cost you less than Samsung's equivalent Care+ plan, though neither is mandatory.

## Final Verdict: Both Are Great, Depending on What Matters Most to You

 In a match between the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, it largely boils down to a fight between camera versatility and software ecosystems.

 The S24 Ultra boasts a monstrous 200MP main sensor compared to the iPhone's 48MP, but it defaults to 12MP photos. However, the iPhone pulls through with a 5x zoom lens and its praised Cinematic mode for video.

 On the display front, the S24 Ultra edges out the iPhone with a slightly higher resolution and peak brightness, but the iPhone counters with superior color accuracy. And, while both phones are high-performance machines, Samsung throws in extra RAM for multitasking prowess.

 Software is a major differentiator, too. iOS offers a straightforward and refined experience, while Samsung's One UI on top of Android focuses on AI features like live translation and advanced photo editing. And both platforms work best with their respective hardware.

 Ultimately, the choice depends on whether you crave the latest camera tech and AI integration (S24 Ultra) or value security, ease of use, and a long software support track record (iPhone 15 Pro Max). And, of course, your existing tech and particular budget play a role as well.
