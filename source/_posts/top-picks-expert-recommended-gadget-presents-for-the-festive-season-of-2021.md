##  The Best Tech Stocking Stuffers

 Stockings are a holiday tradition that many of us adhere to. They're the perfect place to, ironically, put things like socks, underwear, and packs of deodorant---smaller gifts that generally aren't the most exciting to unwrap. But you can always go beyond that if you're looking for something a little more inspirational.

 You could use some of the best tech stocking stuffers to make sure that whoever you're buying for will have one of the best stockings of their lives. All you need is a little bit of ingenuity---and this guide, of course.

LEGO

 LEGO sets always make for a good gift, as long as the person you're buying them for is old enough to try not to eat them.

 This LEGO set is a little bit different, though. Rather than just building or playing, the [LEGO VIDIYO](https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Building-Minifigure-Creative-Producing/dp/B08NFBW8KH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208166&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764196%2Fbest-stocking-stuffers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) includes a minifigure with a guitar, 14 random BeatBits, and two special BeatBits. The free [LEGO VIDIYO app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208166/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.vidiyo&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) can then be used to scan the minifigure and the BeatBits, and then all be used to let kids bring their music to life.

 It's an excellent gift for any kid interested in music, video work, or just those who you think would benefit from a fun, interactive LEGO set.

![top of aerolatte milk frother](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/aerolatte-milk-frother.jpg) 

aerolatte

 We all know at least one person who's incredibly into coffee. We don't just mean they drink it daily---we mean they're the kind of person who talks about the different types of beans with a knowing tone. Someone really into coffee.

 The [aerolatte Milk Frother](https://www.amazon.com/Aerolatte-Original-HandHeld-Frother-Satin/dp/B0002KZUNK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208166&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764196%2Fbest-stocking-stuffers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a nifty little gift for coffee fans. It's straightforward to use and is submerged in a glass of milk and used for up to sixty seconds to create wonderfully frothy milk befitting a fancy cappuccino.

 Thanks to its size, it's also effortless to pack, making it an excellent stocking stuffer and a perfect travel tool.

![Lamicall phone holder on table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lamicall-gooseneck-mount.jpg) 

Lamicall

 Pretty much all of us use our phones in bed. Who can resist a little bit of aimless scrolling or a few rounds of a mobile game before going to sleep?

 You can buy someone the [Lamicall Phone Holder](https://www.amazon.com/Gooseneck-Bed-Phone-Holder-Mount/dp/B07S9JXQP2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208166&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764196%2Fbest-stocking-stuffers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) to make that late-night phone time easier for them. It's an easy-to-attach gooseneck stand that is compatible with a variety of phones.

 The flexible neck means it's also straightforward to adjust for scrolling, reading, watching videos, or just keeping the phone somewhere specific. Lamicall's holder is useful and inexpensive, two great qualities for a stocking stuffer.

##  Votozi Star Night Light Projector: See the Stars While Inside

![collage of night light pictures](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/starry-night-light.jpg) 

Votozi

 There's something inherently comforting about stars, even the glow-in-the-dark ones lots of people had as kids.

 You can give the gift of stars to someone in your life by buying them the [Votozi Star Night Light Projector](https://www.amazon.com/Night-Votozi-Projector-Degree-Rotation/dp/B092YYV588?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208166&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764196%2Fbest-stocking-stuffers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). This night light projects different colored stars, planets, and even the moon onto the room around it. It has different settings and lighting effects and can be powered using batteries or a power cable.

 It's better for kids than adults, but most people will get at least a smile out of it.

One Fire

 Buying presents for someone with a really young child can be tricky. Oftentimes you're better off buying them a present that benefits both the parent and the baby.

 The [One Fire Night Light for Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Toddler-Children-Silicone-Changing-Birthday/dp/B08SQ7DJ93?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208166&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764196%2Fbest-stocking-stuffers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is an excellent choice in that regard because everyone involved is going to get some use out of it.
