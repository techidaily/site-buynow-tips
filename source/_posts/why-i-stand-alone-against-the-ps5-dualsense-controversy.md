## Why I Stand Alone Against the PS5 DualSense Controversy

### Key Takeaways

* DualSense controller is too big and bulky, causing discomfort for some users.
* Many games do not fully utilize the DualSense features, limiting its immersive potential.
* DualSense feels cheap compared to the premium look and feel of its predecessor, and battery life may be inadequate for heavy usage.

 I own two PlayStation 5s and got my first one at launch. I love this console, and the time I've spent with it, but the biggest disappointment for me was going from the DualShock 4 to the DualSense. So much so that I'm surprised by the universal praise it gets.

##  It’s Too Big and Bulky

 The PlayStation 3's controller was too thin, light, creaky, and dinky for me. The PS4, on the other hand, absolutely nailed the ergonomics of controller design in my opinion, and it's the controller that has caused me the least discomfort over the years. I have fairly average-sized hands for a man, but the grips feel too bulbous and thick. It's hardly an Xbox Duke, but it still feels like unnecessary inflation in the hand. Potentially something that was needed to accommodate the new technology inside? Whatever the reason, I still use my DS4 on my PS5 for games that support it.

##  Not Enough Games Use the DualSense Features

_Sony PlayStation_

 The different haptic features of the DualSense are [truly amazing](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-unlock-your-google-pixel-8-by-drfone-android/). In games that use the detailed vibrations and trigger resistance well, it gives you a whole new level of immersion. The only problem is that so few games use these features to their full potential. There's hardly a difference in cross-platform games, at least the ones that I have played. So it's largely the relatively limited first-party and platform exclusive games that get good DualSense implementation. Maybe that's enough for most people, but having bought the hardware on a fixed platform, I'd expect software created to run on that platform to use these key features, and it's been too thin on the ground.

##  It Feels Cheap Compared to Its Predecessor

Sydney Louw Butler / How-To Geek

 Speaking of the PS4 controller, when I first got my hands on it, it was like going from a paper-thin econobox car to a luxury German sedan. The materials, the look, the feel, it was all so premium. The DualSense feels tacky and plastic. It's cool that they've put tiny PlayStation symbols on the surface to act as grip, but ultimately the plastic feels scratchy and cheap. Which isn't great because, in actual price, DualSense controllers are anything but cheap.

##  Battery Life Is Barely Adequate

 There are a lot of online complaints about the [battery life of the DualSense controller](https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/shortcuts-to-fluent-urdu/) online, but I think they are largely overblown. Yes, if you play a game that makes heavy use of the DualSense features, you might only get four hours of battery life from it before needing a charge, but for an average player like me, there's hardly any game session I'd have that lasts longer than three hours straight.

 The real problem comes from forgetting to charge the controller, and picking it up only for the battery to be dead. This is why I invested in [official charging cradles](https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Charging-Station-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6Y4VG/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004102&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Feveryone-loves-the-ps5s-dualsense-controller-except-me%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen). There is apparently a "[V2](https://za.ign.com/dualsense-edge/188519/news/ps5-v2-dualsense-with-exceptional-12-hour-battery-life-spotted-online)" DualSense controller with much improved battery life, but I haven't had the privilege of trying one myself. That said, I really appreciate my Xbox Series and Switch Pro controllers, which simply keep trucking for days with no complaints.

##  On a PC, You Need USB to Get the Most Out of It

 This last little niggle only affects PC gamers, and if we're being honest, [PlayStation controller support in Windows](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-efficient-techniques-to-preserve-webcam-dialogues/) has always been terrible. However, there are some games on PC that let you experience the full effect of DualSense features without having to own a PlayStation 5.

 Except, you have to connect your controller to your PC using a USB cable for this to work! For some reason, a Bluetooth connection can't get you the full DualSense experience. Maybe it's not a dealbreaker or anything, but it is annoying. However, it does solve the battery life issue!
