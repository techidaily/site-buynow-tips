##  What to Look for in a TV Backlight in 2024

 TV backlights are a great investment to enhance your viewing experience with vibrant colors and improved visual appeal. However, they aren't all the same. Some can be controlled via your smartphone, some only have set color choices, whereas others can dance to your favorite music.

 Whether you're looking to create an immersive atmosphere for your friends for movie night or just want to heighten the mood in your home, a [TV backlight](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/unlocking-iphone-contact-problems-discover-3-effective-remedies/) can change most home entertainment spots into something quite fancy.

 There are several factors to consider when buying a TV backlight, though. First, you'll want to look for options with adjustable brightness levels. The last thing you want is for the lighting to be so bright that it causes a distraction when you're watching [TV](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/master-the-remastered-yakuza-3-for-pc-with-these-essential-stability-fixes/). Similarly, a range of color options allows you to create the desired ambiance. RGB LEDs, for example, have millions of colors to choose from.

 Some backlights have a remote control for easy adjustments, while others may have built-in controls or smartphone apps for seamless operation. Depending on your requirements, you may prefer one type over another. On a similar note, there are models of TV backlights that can be USB powered (handy to connect straight to your TV), whereas others need to be powered via a normal power outlet.

 Ultimately, the TV backlight you choose should fit your TV. Different brands may offer a variety of sizes, so be sure to purchase the correct one. Many backlight kits are flexible and can be cut or extended to fit different TV sizes, so it's worth considering this too.

##  Best TV Backlight Overall: [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Envisual-Backlight-Ultra-Thin-H605C/dp/B0BCQ9YQYW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

Govee

| Pros                                 | Cons                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| ✓ Bright and colorful LEDs           | ✗ Calibration takes a little while  |
| ✓ Easy to install                    | ✗ Camera required on top of your TV |
| ✓ Reactive lighting is very accurate |                                     |
| ✓ Reliable brand                     |                                     |

 The [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Envisual-Backlight-Ultra-Thin-H605C/dp/B0BCQ9YQYW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an easy-to-install and immersive way to brighten up your entertainment quarters. However, it's worth noting that if your TV is wall mounted, you will need to take it down during installation. Once you have access to the back of the TV, it's a case of attaching the adhesive LED strips and turning the lights on. Clips are included, too, in case you need them.

 Calibrating the lights is a little more challenging. You'll need to place a camera on the top of your TV, which can be difficult if you have a thin TV like the [LG 65-inch Class UR9000](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Bluetooth-Ethernet-AI-Powered/dp/B0BVXG2G5N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). Still, it is possible, but it does need to stay there permanently to use the Govee Envisual T2\. Once set up, however, you'll first notice how vivid and bright the LEDs are (without overpowering the TV's lighting). If you have a light-colored wall, the effect is even more apparent, feeling instantly immersive.

 Using the [Govee Home app](https://www.govee.com/govee-home) to control the Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2 is easy. In the app, you can customize the LEDs to display different patterns or colors. The reactive lighting is far more accurate on the T2 than the [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T1](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). For example, if there is a lot of blue and red on the screen, the lights will adjust smoothly to reflect this.

 As well as using the app, you can also control this TV backlight using your voice. For instance, you can ask [Google Home](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-verizon-iphone-13-pro-by-drfone-ios/) to turn on or off the device---pretty cool if you forget to turn them off when you're already tucked up in bed.

 With recent software updates, the Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2 features a new vivid mode that divides the TV screen into zones and individually captures content in each zone. The black screen detection feature also helps to save energy when the backlight isn't on, automatically turning the lighting off when low screen brightness or a black screen is detected.

 For an immersive experience, no matter what you're watching or playing on your TV, the Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2 is a great investment. Yes, it's a lot more expensive than most TV backlights, but it really is worth it when the reactive lighting kicks in.

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

 If you don't want to invest a lot of money into your TV backlights but still want an immersive product, the [Nexillumi LED Lights](https://www.amazon.com/Nexillumi-LED-Lights-60-75-Inch/dp/B07XBJR7GY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) are a solid alternative. These affordable lights come in various sizes, including [6.56ft](https://www.amazon.com/Nexillumi-LED-Lights-60-75-Inch/dp/B07JK9FDRP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [9.8ft](https://www.amazon.com/Nexillumi-LED-Lights-60-75-Inch/dp/B07X3BS3DF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [13.2ft](https://www.amazon.com/Nexillumi-LED-Lights-60-75-Inch/dp/B07XBJR7GY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [16.4ft](https://www.amazon.com/Nexillumi-LED-Lights-60-75-Inch/dp/B096VM6Q8G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [32.8ft](https://www.amazon.com/Nexillumi-LED-Lights-60-75-Inch/dp/B0BVW1PZZ2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). You can choose the right size depending on the size of your TV.

 Like the [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Envisual-Backlight-Ultra-Thin-H605C/dp/B0BCQ9YQYW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the Nexillumi LED Lights can also be controlled via your smartphone using the [Illumi Home app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228051/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lxillumi.illumihome&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US). Alternatively, you can use the included [IR remote](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevating-visual-storytelling-expert-techniques-for-instagram-video-edits/) if you don't want to use app controls. Using the app or remote, you can control the lights' brightness, color, and speed. You can also switch them on or off. However, if you are using the remote, be aware that it won't work unless it's in range of the receiver.

 Since the Nexillumi LED Lights are USB-powered, you can plug them directly into your TV's USB port to power them. Alternatively, you can use a USB plug or power bank if you don't have one. This also means you could easily transport the TV backlights to another TV without much fuss.

 However, you wouldn't be able to use the Nexillumi LED Lights other than for your TV due to the corner-friendly cords. For example, if you use them under a desk or counter, there would be clear sections where the lights aren't visible due to the corded design.

 If you're happy to use the Nexillumi LED Lights on the back of your TV, you'll be pleasantly surprised. You're getting decent lighting with adjustable colors, brightness, and music modes for the cost. While the lights won't react or sync to what's on your TV, they do provide immersive lighting that won't break the bank.

While this TV backlight is immersive and extremely stunning, you will need to fork out on a [Philips Hue Bridge](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Smart-Google-Assistant/dp/B016H0QZ7I?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Hue Sync Box](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Splitter-Colored-Required/dp/B086ZJLCTW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), if you don't already have them. But, if you already have these devices, the Philips Hue Gradient LightStrip is a welcome addition to home entertainment enthusiasts.

 The Philips Hue Gradient LightStrip is made of flexible silicone, making it easy to bend when installing it. Mounting brackets are included, so you can fit the lighting tube to suit your TV. However, this device is not extendable or cuttable, unlike some TV backlights. You'll need to ensure you purchased the right size for your TV.

 Once installed, the Philips Hue Gradient LightStrip supports 16 million colors, outputting 1,100 lumens. As well as different color selections, you can also use this TV backlight to add extra lighting to your room with its simple white light option. You can set the [color temperature](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-winning-strategies-elevating-win11-zoom-experience/) between 2,000K to 6,500K depending on the atmosphere you want to create.

 Using the [Philips Hue app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228051/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/apps), there's a wealth of preset gradients you can choose from, different visuals, scenes, and so on. The app is fairly detailed and gives you access to any other Philips Hue products you have in your home. In addition to the app, you can also control the Philips Hue Gradient LightStrip with your voice using [Google Assistant](https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/archiving-made-simple-saving-chatgpt-talks/) voice commands.

 Connecting the Philips Hue Gradient LightStrip to the Philips Hue Sync Box allows the lights to sync and react to what's happening on the TV, much like the [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Envisual-Backlight-Ultra-Thin-H605C/dp/B0BCQ9YQYW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)'s camera. Syncing is necessary if you want different lighting options for your movies, games, and music. While you could use the lights without the box, they would be pointless since they wouldn't react.

 It's a more expensive option, but the Philips Hue Gradient LightStrip is really worth the money if you're looking to invest in other [Philips Hue products](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-trim-vlc-videos-on-mac-with-ease-no-quality-loss-guaranteed-for-2024/). So, you can sit back, relax, and feel fully immersed in whatever you're doing on your TV.

_Daybetter_

| Pros                               | Cons                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ✓ Budget-friendly                  | ✗ Not reactive to visuals |
| ✓ USB-powered                      | ✗ Lack of voice support   |
| ✓ Different size options available |                           |

 TV backlights can be expensive, especially if you invest in an ecosystem like Philips Hue. However, if you are happy with sound-reactive lights that won't cost you an arm and a leg, the [Daybetter LED Lights](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B09713WJZG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) could be a better option. These lights are USB-powered and come in various sizes including [9.84ft](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B0BTYPJZHW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [12.5ft](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B09Q7ZDJ7T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [14.8ft](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B0BKL8XKFF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [15ft](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B09713WJZG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [16.4ft](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B0BKLBR4NM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [18ft](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B0BKL7KCW5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [20ft](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B0BKLD2M5R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Installation is simple; just peel off the adhesive backing and place the lights where you want them on the back of your TV. The receiver can also be installed on the back, so it stays out of sight. Similar to the [Nexillumi LED Lights](https://www.amazon.com/Nexillumi-LED-Lights-60-75-Inch/dp/B07XBJR7GY?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the Daybetter LED Lights can be controlled via the [Apollo Lighting app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU228051/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qh.Apollo&hl=en&gl=US), or the included remote.

 You can use the app to change the light colors, style, and set timers. And, since the Daybetter LED Lights come with a built-in microphone, the brightness and color of the LEDs will change depending on the music it hears. It might not be as immersive as TV backlights that are visually reactive, but you have to weigh up the cost versus the extra features.

 Thanks to the versatility of these TV backlights, you could also use them behind your computer's monitor or under your desk for the ultimate gaming experience. What's more, the Daybetter LED Lights are bright enough to enhance the visuals in your room without causing your eyes to shift from what's on the screen.

 At an affordable cost, the Daybetter LED Lights are easy to use, install, and expand upon if you want to in the future. With a wealth of sizes available and the choice of app or remote control, these TV backlights suit a wide range of users.

Best Budget TV Backlight

#####  Daybetter LED Lights

Providing an immersive experience on a budget, this TV backlight is easy to install and can be controlled via the included remote or smartphone app.

[See at amazon](https://www.amazon.com/DAYBETTER-Backlights-65-75in-Backlight-Bedroom/dp/B09713WJZG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

##  Best Voice-Controlled TV Backlight: [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T1](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                                    | Cons                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✓ Cheaper than the T2 version           | ✗ Color reactive lighting is less accurate than the T2 |
| ✓ Bright and immersive                  |                                                        |
| ✓ Easy to install                       |                                                        |

 Slightly more affordable than the [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T2](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Envisual-Backlight-Ultra-Thin-H605C/dp/B0BCQ9YQYW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), the [Govee Envisual TV Backlight T1](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Immersion-Backlights-Ambient-Assistant/dp/B08LVPWQQP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228051&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F900954%2Fbest-tv-backlights%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) also offers a stunning and immersive lighting display, installed to the back of your TV. The backlight is installed in the same way as the T2 and continues to include a camera which must be placed on the top of your TV to capture onscreen colors in order to offer reactive color recognition. However, Govee says the T1 is 40% less accurate when compared to the T2.

 You can control the lighting using the [Govee Home app](https://www.govee.com/govee-home) by customizing individual segments or multiple colors. There are also over 99 scene modes and video modes you can choose from. For example, you can set the lights to a Christmas setting to add that extra bit of magic during the holiday season.

 But, if you'd rather the Govee Envisual TV Backlight T1 simply reacted to what's on screen, you can adjust these settings, too. The camera picks up the main colors it detects on your TV's screen and syncs the LEDs to display similar colors. The reactive lighting isn't entirely accurate, but it's still enjoyable. Similarly, the built-in microphone in the control box allows you to sync the lights to music, with four different modes to choose from.

 Easily control the Govee Envisual TV Backlight T1 using Google Assistant or [Amazon Alexa](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-illusions-realized-what-is-augmented-reality-for-2024/). Turn the lights on or off, set a timer, or switch modes on the fly. Simply power on the control box by plugging it into a standard power outlet in your home and get the party started in your lounge.

 If you don't want to spend as much on the T2 version, the Govee Envisual TV Backlight T1 is still incredibly impressive, providing bright and vivid lights behind your TV. And, if your TV is mounted to a light-colored wall, the LEDs will be exceptionally stunning.

Best Voice-Controlled TV Backlight

#####  Govee Envisual TV Backlight T1

Reactive TV lighting doesn't need to be expensive. Control your TV backlight via the Govee Home app or using your voice with Alexa and Google Assistant.
