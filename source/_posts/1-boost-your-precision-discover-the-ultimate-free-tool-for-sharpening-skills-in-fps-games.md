## 1. Boost Your Precision: Discover the Ultimate Free Tool for Sharpening Skills in FPS Games

### Key Takeaways

* Aimlabs targets core FPS skills such as flicking, target switching, and target tracking.
* Having been developed by a diverse team that includes neuroscientists, developers, and other games, Aimlabs provides science-backed training.
* Aimlabs offers extensive customization options, game-specific training, and performance insights.

 First-person shooters have been a personal favorite since my first time playing Halo as a kid. I typically do well in co-op games but have continually struggled in competitive multiplayer. That is, until I discovered this hidden gem.

##  How Aimlabs Improved My Aim

[Aimlabs](https://aimlabs.com/) is an online first- and third-person aim trainer that sets tasks and playlists designed to hone core shooter skills like flicking, target switching, and target tracking. Tasks are designed to help players improve their speed, perception, and cognition skills in first-person shooter (FPS) and multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games.

 After each task, Aimlabs offers players feedback and tips, game playback, and an accuracy heat map. Information gathered from each task is then used to suggest additional tasks. Lessons under the "Learn" tab work the same way.

 Because Aimlabs breaks down the action of aiming into these various skills, I finally understood exactly what aspects of my aim I needed to work on. Within just a few days of play, I saw improvement in my overall reaction time, my ability to hit moving targets, and in tactical movements such as wall peeking.

 After a few weeks of training, my kill-to-death ratio in other games started to see some improvement as well. As with any skill, though, [consistent practice is the key to success](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-access-6-leading-free-and-on-demand-youtube-short-downloader-tools/). I had stopped playing for a few months, and there was a noticeable difference in my skill level when I returned.

##  The Science Behind Aimlabs

 As its parent company explains, Aimlabs was created by “people who love gaming, who also happen to be neuroscientists, designers, developers, and computer vision pioneers.” This means that Aimlabs’ training plans and features are backed by scientific research and are curated by gamers, for gamers.

 One feature that Aimlabs highly recommends players use is the Game Profile. This matches certain settings to that of whatever game you’re training for to help keep metrics uniform and give you the most accurate training scenarios possible. If you play _Valorant_ or _Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege_, this feature is even more important as Aimlabs has been named the official FPS training partner for both games.

 When I first started playing Aimlabs, I opted to keep my game profile in the default Aimlabs mode since I was looking to improve my foundational skills. I only played general training tasks such as Reflexshot, which trains your precision by having you aim for targets that randomly appear in your field of vision. In this task, targets also increase and decrease in size based on your performance to keep you training at your threshold.

 Now that I’ve advanced to game-specific training for _Valorant_, some of my most played tasks have been Valorant Ascent Tracking, which helps players track moving targets; VCT Fracture Operator, which trains players’ sniper skills; and VCT Latam, which hones players’ flicking and peeking skills.

 Another setting that Aimlabs urges players to adjust is the mouse or controller sensitivity. I opted to do this through Aimlabs’s Flick Optimizer, which runs players through three tasks several times at different sensitivity levels and analyzes the results to find your ideal sensitivity.

 Users who upgrade to the Aimlabs+ subscription ($12.99/month) or purchase the ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Edition mouse can get further insights. However, the basic analysis will suffice for the majority of non-competitive players.

 Aimlabs isn’t just about the right settings and solo training, though. Along with the official Aimlabs content, players can create custom tasks, weapons, and playlists. Additionally, you can collaborate with friends and create custom content to share with the community. Players are also able to compete against one another, either ranked or unranked, and you can track your progress through the community leaderboards.

As previously mentioned, users can opt to pay for an Aimlabs+ monthly, semi-annual, or annual subscription which provides more insights, the Discovery AI training engine which is replacing their ProGuides program, bonus Aimlabs Battlepass rewards, and more goodies.
