##  What to Look for in a 75-inch TV in 2023

 Now that you have decided to get a big-screen TV for your home, there are a few things to consider to ensure you get the best experience possible.

 First and foremost, you have to settle on display panel technology. Most modern TVs use one of the two major display types—[LED-backlit LCD](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-unraveling-untethered-art-top-public-domain-gems-for-2024/) and [OLED](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/).

 While OLED TVs provide superior picture quality because of their near-infinite contrast ratio and perfect blacks, they are expensive and can suffer from [permanent burn-in](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-virtual-arena-transcript/). On the other hand, LED-backlit LCD TVs (or LED TVs) are relatively cheaper and aren't susceptible to burn-in.

 But they fall short of reaching OLED-level picture quality, even with newer technologies like [quantum dot](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/how-to-do-time-lapse-on-samsung-phones/) and [full-array local dimming](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/learn-how-to-update-driver-software-for-corsair-audio-devices-on-windows-systems/). Basically, you need to decide whether you want the absolute best picture possible or save on price and time on [OLED upkeep](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-laughter-ledger-ranking-the-highest-viral-jokes/).

 Secondly, if you primarily use your TV for gaming or watching movies, you will want features to match the use case. For example, the [best gaming TVs](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-visionvoice-tips-for-perfectly-sized-insta-posts/) have a [variable refresh rate](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/) (VRR), [Auto Low Latency Mode](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/) (ALLM), and [HDMI 2.1 ports](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) to support 4K gaming at 120fps. In contrast, the best TVs for movies have better HDR support, superior image processing, and excellent [upscaling capability](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/).

 Lastly, if you have the budget, you may also want to consider 8K. [8K TVs](https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-ways-to-manage-your-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-location-settings-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/) don't just bring extra pixels, but they also include the best of what manufacturers have to offer in terms of TV technology.

 Before we jump into our recommendations, it's important to note that we have included both 75-inch and 77-inch TVs in this guide. All major TV manufacturers have released their new OLED TVs in 77-inches instead of 75-inches. It's almost impossible to imagine a best TV list without OLED TVs, so make sure if you're getting one that you have the extra space.

##  Best 77-inch TV Overall: [LG G3](https://www.amazon.com/LG-55-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED55G3PUA/dp/B0BVWYRK3G/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![An LG OLED Evo G3 in a display room](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/35caa1b5.jpg) 

Josh Hendrickson / How-to Geek

| Pros                           | Cons      |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Impressive picture quality     | Expensive |
| Advanced gaming features       |           |
| Dolby Vision and Atmos support |           |

 The [G3](https://www.amazon.com/LG-55-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED55G3PUA/dp/B0BVWYRK3G/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) sits on top of LG’s 4K TV lineup, and for good reason. It’s an exceptional television that delivers in pretty much every aspect. So, if you want a 4K TV of around 75 inches, there is no better option than the 77-inch LG G3.

 The LG TV uses an [OLED evo panel](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-correctly-address-and-repair-a-missing-mscorwksdll-error/) with [Micro Lens Array (MLA) technology](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) to deliver inky blacks and high [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/). As a result, the colors just pop on the screen, and you can enjoy content in dark and bright rooms. There is support for both [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) and [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) to watch HDR content from various sources. The G3 also packs [Dolby Atmos](https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) and DTS audio support, the latter of which was missing from its predecessor.

 Gaming is another strong point of the G3, as it includes all the advanced features you may want to get the best out of modern consoles and gaming PCs. It has a 120Hz screen, [NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) support, and a low input lag. You also get native apps for [NVIDIA GeForce Now](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/smileshop-memelore-hub/) and [Amazon Luna](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-2024-av1-versus-vp9-the-ultimate-codec-showdown/) cloud gaming services.

 webOS is LG’s smart TV operating system of choice and doesn’t disappoint. There are apps for all the popular streaming services and more. The interface is reasonably smooth and snappy.

 Being a flagship-grade OLED TV, the LG G3 is expensive. But if its price tag is out of your reach, you can also consider the [77-inch LG C3](https://www.amazon.com/LG-77-Inch-Class-OLED77C3PUA-Built/dp/B0BVX61P9B/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which shares many features with the G3 but lacks the MLA technology. So it doesn’t get as bright as the G3.

Hisense

| Pros                                       | Cons                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Deep blacks and vibrant colors             | Poor viewing angles |
| VRR support and low input lag in Game Mode | Some color fringing |
| Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support            |                     |

 The [Hisense U6K](https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-75-Inch-Mini-LED-Google-75U6K/dp/B0C6XMBLJL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) shines as an affordable, value-for-money 4K television. It has an LCD panel with quantum dot technology, full-array local dimming (FALD), and [Mini-LED backlighting](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). As a result, the TV produces deep blacks, lifelike colors, and reasonable brightness. So you will enjoy watching movies, TV shows, and sports on it. Dolby Vision and [HDR10+](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/) support is present, giving you access to almost all HDR content.

 Advanced gaming features are missing, but you still get a low input lag for responsive gaming and VRR support to reduce screen tearing in the 48Hz to 60Hz range. Four HDMI 2.0 ports are also on board, one of which handles [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) duties.

 Google TV is responsible for the software, at least in the US, and it has become a pretty decent operating system. It gives you access to a wide range of apps, including popular streaming services. Plus, you can use both [Alexa and Google Assistant](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-guide-to-crafting-igtv-cover-photos/) via the remote or the mics built directly into the TV.

 Being a budget TV, the U6K has its drawbacks. As it uses a VA-type LCD panel, the viewing angles are poor. The TV also has [trouble smoothing low-resolution content](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/hisense/u6k#test%5F18014), and you may notice some [color-fringing around moving objects](https://reviewed.usatoday.com/televisions/content/hisense-u6k-mini-led-tv-review).

 The [QN900B](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-65-Inch-Infinity-Tracking-QN65QN900BFXZA/dp/B09TQ49SXX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is Samsung's flagship 8K television. It's chock-full of TV technologies guaranteed to offer one of the best television viewing experiences. Beyond that, the TV looks and feels as premium as its price tag. It's super slim, as a lot of its components and all of its ports are housed in the [One Connect Box](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fanswer%2FANS00062213%2F) that you can keep away from the TV.

 Being a [Neo QLED](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/explore-1-5-iphone-podcast-platforms-for-all-for-2024/) television, it comes with Mini-LED backlighting, full-array local dimming, and quantum dot technology. These contribute to the television's fantastic picture quality and HDR performance. Sadly, there is no Dolby Vision support, but you get [HDR10+ Adaptive](https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mirthful-content-extraction-report/) and [HDR10+ Gaming](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-your-tecno-pop-7-pro-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/).

 With 8K televisions, there is an obvious concern around content. So you will be happy to know that the QN900B is great at upscaling lower-resolution content. Moreover, you get [ATSC 3.0](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/ai-writing-unmasked-5-must-have-detectors-for-academic-and-corporate-leaders/) for high-resolution broadcast TV.

 There is a ton to like on the gaming front as well. The television has a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz, and there is support for [AMD FreeSync Premium Pro](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-from-chats-to-files-the-methodical-approach-to-downloading-fb-video-for-2024/) for tear-free gaming. You also get four HDMI 2.1 ports, low input lag, fast response time, and ALLM. Plus, Samsung includes a Gaming Hub that offers access to the [NVIDIA GeForce Now](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-30fps-versus-60fps-best-choice-for-clear-video-capture-for-2024/) game streaming service.

 Tizen handles the software duties and has apps for all popular streaming services. However, while both reviewers and customers typically favored the previous version of its interface, the new version isn't [getting a lot of love](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-qn900b-neo-qled-8k-tv).

 Pricing is another reason that might keep people away from the QN900B. But if you are keen on an 8K TV, the [Hisense U800GR](https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-Premium-75U800GR-Quantum-Compatibility/dp/B09D8R3TD3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent alternative. It costs considerably less but still offers a great experience. Additionally, QN900B's predecessor, the [QN900A](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftelevisions-home-theater%2Ftvs%2Fsamsung-neo-qled-8k%2F75-qn900a-neo-qled-8k-smart-tv-2021-qn75qn900afxza%2F), is a fantastic option. It's cheaper than the QN900B but harder to find in stock.

| Excellent picture quality          |                                      |

 Gamers have much to like about the [LG C3](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED65C3PUA/dp/B0BVX61P9B?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It packs all the next-generation features you may need, along with one of the best picture qualities on the market. It houses LG’s OLED evo panel that supports VRR and can go anywhere between 20Hz and 120Hz. Plus, thanks to AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync support, you can use the TV with PCs using an AMD or NVIDIA graphics card. There is support for Low Framerate Compensation (LFC) as well to avoid [screen tearing](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-preloaded-features-of-chatgpt-functions-and-implementation-tips/) when the game frame rate drops below 20Hz.

 Video games feel responsive as the C3 has a low input lag. And the LG’s Game Optimizer feature aids gaming with optimized settings for various game genres. It also brings all the gaming-related options in one place for quick access. The C3 has native apps for NVIDIA GeForce Now and Amazon Luna cloud gaming services. You can also enjoy HDR games thanks to Dolby Vision and HDR10 support. Additionally, you get four HDMI 2.1 ports, including one for eARC. 

 Beyond gaming, the LG C3 is a fantastic TV for enjoying movies, sports, and TV shows. So whether you are playing Call of Duty or watching the latest season of Stranger Things, you will have no qualms.

 Of course, the C3 isn’t perfect. It doesn’t get as bright as the G3 or the newest [QD-OLED](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solved-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-keeps-crashing/) models from Samsung and Sony. Lastly, if you use it as a display for your gaming PC, there will be a risk of burn-in if there are static elements in the PC interface.

##  Best 77-inch TV for Movies: [Sony A80K](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-A80K-Playstation®/dp/B09R95CGSW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

| Pros                                             | Cons                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Fantastic picture quality                        | Burn-in is a concern                          |
| Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and DTS Audio support | Lower peak brightness than competing OLED TVs |
| Two HDMI 2.1 ports                               | Expensive                                     |

 If you're primarily buying a new television to enjoy movies on a big screen, the [77-inch Sony A80K OLED TV](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-A80K-Playstation®/dp/B09R95CGSW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a solid pick. However, like the LG C3, it doesn't come in a 75-inch size, so make sure you have space for a 77-inch TV.

 The A80K is a 4K television and packs Sony's masterful processing chops, which helps it deliver excellent upscaling, motion, and picture performance. So whether you are watching a movie on DVD or catching the latest Netflix release in 4K HDR, you'll have a great experience.

 The TV also supports Dolby Vision and has a respectable peak brightness to deliver a decent HDR experience. However, [Sony's flagship A95K TV](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-A95K-Playstation®/dp/B09R94DJ72/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) gets significantly brighter, but it's only available in 55-inch and 65-inch sizes. So if you care more about the TV's brightness than its size, go for the A95K.

 In other highlights, the A80K has wide viewing angles, excellent out-of-the-box color accuracy, and a wide color gamut. It also shines above the competing LG and Samsung models in its ability to process or pass DTS audio formats, often used by movie studios in the primary track of their UHD Blu-ray releases. Neither LG nor Samsung TVs support DTS audio.

 The Sony A80K is also a good television for tasks beyond watching movies. For example, it has two HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K 120fps gaming and support for VRR and ALLM. Sadly, its [input lag is a bit higher](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/sony/a80k-oled) than our gaming pick, but it will be fine for casual gamers.

| Pros                                    | Cons                           |

| Low input lag in Game Mode              | Narrow viewing angles          |

 Primarily known for producing its own streaming sticks and supplying TV software to third-party manufacturers, Roku jumped into the smart TV space in early 2023\. As the Roku TV selection has dwindled, the [Roku Plus Series](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-75-class-plus-series-qled-4k-smart-rokutv%2F6536735.p) has emerged as the best Roku TV you can buy right now. As it comes directly from Roku, it seamlessly integrates the company’s excellent smart TV OS.

 The Plus Series uses quantum dot technology and FALD to offer a solid picture quality that isn’t very common in its price range. There is also support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. Moreover, you can enjoy the Dolby Atmos sound.

 Although it’s not a premium product, the Roku TV has a pretty decent design with slim bezels and good build quality. In terms of ports, you get four HDMI 2.0 ports, one of which is also suitable for eARC.

 Unfortunately, the Roku Plus Series is not the best TV for gamers as it lacks a 120Hz panel and advanced gaming features. But casual gamers can still enjoy their favorite games thanks to its low input lag in [Game Mode](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-how-much-income-arises-from-each-snapshot-video-for-2024/). In other drawbacks, the TV has narrow viewing angles and doesn’t get very bright.

| Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support                      |                           |

 TCL’s 4K flagship, the [QM8](https://www.amazon.com/TCL-75QM850G-Accelerator-Streaming-Television/dp/B0C1J6PP81/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), is the best LED TV to buy in 2023\. It houses all the advanced TV and gaming features you want and delivers an impressive performance. One of the main highlights of the TCL QM8 is its 144Hz refresh rate, which is excellent for high-refresh-rate gaming on your console or PC.

 The TV also packs Mini-LED backlighting and FALD to deliver exceptional contrast ratio and high peak brightness levels. As a result, watching HDR content on the TV is a treat, and you will have no trouble with glare or reflections. The high number of dimming zones on the TV also helps minimize [blooming](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/aster-the-art-of-subtitlecc-integration-in-youtube-with-this-guide-for-2024/) and [black crush](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-compilation-of-excellent-video-capture-tools-for-windows-11/).

 Among other features, the QM8 packs a layer of quantum dots to enable a wide [color gamut](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) for lifelike representation of colors. Additionally, there is support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. Gamers will love the presence of two HDMI 2.1 ports to connect the consoles or gaming PCs. The TCL QM8 also supports VRR and has a low input lag.

 Google TV handles the software duties and is relatively easy to use. You also get a wide selection of apps via the Google Play Store. 

 Sadly, the TCL TV isn’t without its flaws. It has narrow viewing angles and doesn’t offer the [best upscaling experience](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/qm8-qm850g-qled) for low-resolution content. Some people will also miss the [lack of ATSC 3.0 tuner](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/tcl-65-inch-qm8-class-tv-65qm850g). But otherwise, it’s a fantastic LED TV.

## FAQ

### What's the best viewing distance for a 75-inch TV?

 Depending on whom you ask, there are a few different recommendations for the [best TV viewing distance](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-samsung-galaxy-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). So it's best to try each out and choose the one you are most comfortable with. For example, Panasonic and Sony suggest putting your 75-inch 4K TV about 4.6 feet from your couch. But if you own a full HD TV, this distance increases to 9.2 feet. On the other hand, THX recommends a distance of 7.5-11.25 feet regardless of your TV's resolution.

### How do I find the best settings for my TV?

 Popular reviews website [Rtings.com](https://www.rtings.com/tv) is your best bet for finding suitable settings for your television. It publishes the settings for every television it reviews. But if you cannot find your television on Rtings.com, the next best thing would be to contact fellow TV enthusiasts on the [AV Forums](https://www.avforums.com/) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

### Does it matter which HDMI port I use?

 Different HDMI ports on your TV can have different capabilities. So yes, it matters which HDMI port you use. For example, if you connect an AV receiver or soundbar to your TV, the HDMI port marked [ARC](https://change-location.techidaily.com/which-pokemon-can-evolve-with-a-moon-stone-for-vivo-s18e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) or [eARC port](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) is most suitable. However, if you are using [Microsoft](https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-X/dp/B08H75RTZ8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [Sony's latest-generation console](https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-5-Console/dp/B0BCNKKZ91/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208116&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764804%2Fbest-75-inch-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you would want one of the [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) (often marked 4K 120Hz) ports.
