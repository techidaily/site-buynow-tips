 Netgear's Orbi Mesh Wi-Fi is the company's first specifically-made[mesh router system](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178) , with a pair of units acting as a base station and a "satellite" unit to provide corner-to-corner coverage at a 5,000-square-foot home. The system is simple to set up via Netgear's Orbi smartphone app, so you can get online within minutes of plugging it in.

The Orbi also works with Amazon Alexa voice commands, and the smartphone application allows for parental controls powered by Circle. There's even the ability to set up guest Wi-Fi networks and connect new devices.

 With support for MU-MIMO and eight simultaneous 160MHz channels, plus a 64-bit 1.8GHz quad-core CPU, more devices can use maximum Wi-Fi speeds simultaneously, so you don't need to worry about your family members or roommates slowing down your connection. It's also more than capable of handling even the more tricked-out smart homes, and thanks to WAN port aggregation, it can even manage Multi-Gig internet plans up to 2Gbps.

[$185 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/224631709) [$250 at Adorama.com](https://www.adorama.com/NEXR500.html?slfpid=3)

 Pros

* Very configurable for gamers
* Good 2.4GHz performance
* Easy setup

 Cons

* Poor longer range performance
* Pricey

 One of the best-reviewed gaming routers on the market, Netgear's Nighthawk XR500 is built with gamers in mind. The hardware includes gaming-specific features such as QoS for prioritizing gaming devices on the network for the best possible signal and allocating any extra bandwidth to eliminate lag. A gaming dashboard helps to show real-time bandwidth use, so users can help minimize ping times, while a gaming VPN allows instant connection to any VPN client to maintain security and privacy.

 Monitoring network strength is accessible via the downloadable Netgear smartphone application, and the dual-core 1.7Ghz processor helps to maintain the hardware performance and support the demands of online gaming traffic. With four external antennas for increased signal strength, the XR500 adds MU-MIMO and Quad-Stream technologies for more gaming boost. Add a total network speed of 2.6Gbps across the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, and you've found a gaming router worthy of its price tag.

**Wireless Spec:** 802.11ac | **Security:** WPA2 | **Standard/Speed:** AC2600 | **Bands:** Dual-band | **MU-MIMO:** Yes | **Beamforming:**  Yes | **Wired Ports:**  4

## What to Look for in a Netgear Router

<a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723" border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Ports

 There are a lot of cases where it’s better to plug a computer, game console, or another device into an Ethernet port. Count all the devices you want to connect via Ethernet and look for a Netgear router to accommodate your setup. Most routers have four LAN ports, but if you have many devices to connect, the alternative is to invest in an additional Ethernet switch later. These can expand your Ethernet port options to 16 or 20\. A USB port on a router can also be handy for connecting a printer, external hard drive, or other devices to create sharable storage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Multiple antennas

 You’ll need a Netgear router with multiple antennas unless you live in a tiny studio apartment. Three is enough for most houses and small businesses, but you’ll need four or more if you have a big, multi-story home or a large office. Higher-end routers can have as many as six or eight. Generally speaking, the more antennas, the better your range and connectivity are, though that also depends on the type of router.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Multiple bands

 You can get by with a single-band router for most basic usage, but look for a dual- or tri-band Netgear router if you want to connect many devices. Some dual-band routers can provide a solid connection to up to 20 devices simultaneously, and tri-band routers give you even more options. You'll also want to look at the Wi-Fi standard. Many options support Wi-Fi 6, though Wi-Fi 5 is still the standard.
