 Games consoles are expensive and that makes buying one feel like a monumental decision. Along with the tough choice of picking which console to buy, you also need to figure out the best time to buy it. Let's take a look at some of the most important things to consider before you reach for your wallet.

##  Let Console Libraries Grow

 It may be tempting to buy a console on release day, but there are many reasons to wait until after the launch party. The first few years of a console's life are often its roughest. Hardware problems are at their most prevalent during this time, resulting in early buyers sometimes being affected by issues like the Xbox 360's infamous "red ring of death," a thermal issue that was resolved in later console revisions.

 But even consoles with the smoothest release periods have a limited selection of launch titles, with the majority of these being ports of games from the previous console generation. It usually takes a few years before most consoles see a decent library, and even longer for [these games to drop in price](https://common-error.techidaily.com/fixes-implemented-for-input-not-recognized-problems-on-visual-panels/).

 Even if you're sure that the console you select will receive enough games to justify the purchase, it's worth holding off to see which exclusives come to each console. Certain genres are more prevalent on specific consoles, such as the PlayStation 5 offering RPGs like _Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth_ or the Nintendo Switch offering first-party platformers like _Super Mario Odyssey_. However, there are always surprises, such as the Xbox Series X|S being the launch platform for rhythm-action title _Hi-Fi Rush_ or the Switch receiving remakes of the first three _Front Mission_ games.

 Additionally, with subscription services like [Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/the-updated-method-to-bypass-nokia-c32-frp-by-drfone-android/) becoming increasingly prevalent on consoles, it's worth looking into what each service provides when buying a new system. Along with their pricing and game lineup, each platform's subscription service includes additional perks such as online access, cloud streaming, and discounts on digital purchases, among other benefits.

 Whether you're after the portability of a Nintendo hybrid or the graphical capability of Sony and Microsoft's home consoles, you should take some time to see what each platform offers to determine which one is right for you. Otherwise, you might regret spending hundreds of dollars on a system that ends up as an overpriced paperweight.

##  Availability Matters for Multiplayer

 Another reason that you may be tempted to buy a new console is to play online with friends. When people you know buy a new console for themselves, it's easy to feel left out. But if your main reason for buying a new console is to play with others, you should wait for that system to become more widely available.

 The success of an online game is largely dependent on the size of its player base. Consoles with poor sales or inventory shortages often struggle to reach the player sizes they need, which can negatively impact their online multiplayer titles. While the PlayStation 5 sold millions of units within its first year, its early supply issues forced many people to wait until it availability improved. This didn't deal a massive blow to its online games, but it certainly created problems for PS5 owners who were waiting for their friends to acquire the console.

 In rare cases, a console might never sell enough units to develop a thriving online community. The Wii U is one example of this issue, and the lackluster state of its online titles reflects its disastrous sales. While hit titles like _Splatoon_, _Mario Kart 8_, and _Super Smash Bros. for Wii U_ caught the attention of console owners, most other online titles fell by the wayside. In 2023, the console [discontinued its online services for all titles](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-ideal-digital-talk-initiator/).

 Not all consoles will encounter these problems, and some platforms like the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 formed massive online communities within their first few months. With the growing number of [free-to-play multiplayer games](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfecting-your-on-air-presence-youtube-and-twitch-streaming-through-obs/) and [cross-platform releases](https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/getting-started-in-drone-flying-in-depth-look-at-the-budget-friendly-syma-x5c-rc-quadcopter/), online experiences are more accessible on modern consoles than ever before. However, this need for players means most consoles take time to deliver a worthwhile online experience. As such, you may want to wait an extra year for a console's community to grow before you make a purchase.

 Aside from having a limited selection of games at launch, most consoles rarely include anything other than the bare essentials: a controller, some cables, and the system itself. Rather than paying full price for a console and then buying all your games separately, you can often find a better deal with console bundles.

 Some bundles offer the regular console model alongside a popular pack-in game at a discounted price. Others include more features, such as more storage, multiple pack-in titles, and a few months of an online subscription service like Xbox Game Pass or Nintendo Switch Online. Although these higher-end bundles come with a higher price than the regular console package, they usually cost less than buying everything separately.

 Most modern consoles also receive hardware refreshes throughout their lifespan, each of which caters to varying tastes and needs. If you intend to buy a console that offers the best performance possible, you may want an upgraded model such as the Switch OLED or [the rumored PlayStation 5 Pro](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-srt-mastery-a-detailed-manual-and-tips/). On the other hand, some consoles serve as [simpler yet more affordable alternatives](https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/fixing-laptop-audio-issues-a-step-by-step-guide-to-restoring-internal-speaker-functionality/), such as the Nintendo Switch Lite and PlayStation 5 Digital Edition. There are bundles available for nearly all versions of each console, so you're likely to find one for the specific system you want.

 Regardless of your preferred console, there's little reason to settle for the basic package unless you absolutely cannot wait to get a new system. However, holding off for even a few months can be worthwhile. Standard consoles regularly undergo price drops after the release of new models, and most systems are discounted during sales events such as Black Friday and Amazon's Prime Day.

 Admittedly, it's hard to ignore the allure of a brand-new console. Whether you're after highly-anticipated console exclusives or multiplayer games that your friends are already playing, there are plenty of reasons to pick up a next-gen system or upgrade to the newest version of a console you already own.

 However, waiting for a console to drop in price, offer better bundles, and potentially release an improved model will help save money and avoid any purchases that you may later regret.
