## Leading Innovative Smart Scale Models for Health Tracking - 2024 Edition

###### [Read update](https://howto.techidaily.com/why-your-infinix-hot-40-screen-might-be-unresponsive-and-how-to-fix-it-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) 

* We've reviewed our recommendations and are confident these are still the best smart bathroom scales you can buy.

 A typical scale will display your weight, but smart bathroom scales can help with fitness goals and provide in-depth information about your body, like your BMI, body fat percentage, and muscle mass. They can also automatically log your weight and other data to your phone.

###  UPDATE: 12/29/2023

 We've reviewed our recommendations and are confident these are still the best smart bathroom scales you can buy.

##  What to Look For in a Smart Bathroom Scale

 Before purchasing a smart bathroom scale, you'll want to consider what you want it for. Are you embarking on a weight loss journey and want to regularly track your progress and learn about your Body Mass Index (BMI) and lean muscle mass? Or, do you just want a higher-tech scale that will provide more health metrics than your normal scale? It's important to figure out your goals, so you have a better idea of which smart scale is best for you.

 Many smart bathroom scales can sync up with [fitness trackers](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-health-advocacy-through-strategic-social-media-plays/) or accompanying apps. This feature is particularly nice if you want to keep up-to-date body metrics in one place. Sometimes, you may be able to look over information from your smart bathroom scale, fitness activity stats, and overall progress from one app.

 The maximum weight limit may be another factor you want to consider. For people in larger bodies, finding a scale with a higher weight capacity may be a top priority. Some picks on our list go up to 400 pounds.

 Lastly, quite a few smart bathroom scales allow for multiple user accounts---some have enough storage for up to 16 people. Perhaps you're part of a fitness group training for a marathon, or you live with a few people who also want to use the scale. Regardless, it's an option that many items on our list offer and is something you can keep in mind.

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ 400 pound weight limit        | ✗ Not intended for use by professional athletes      |
| ✓ 16 detailed body measurements | ✗ Standing on it with wet feet may alter the metrics |
| ✓ Affordable price point        |                                                      |

 Our top pick for smart bathroom scales goes to the [eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NHR4NX7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204028&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840151%2Fbest-smart-bathroom-scales%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), a more high-tech and advanced model from its two predecessors, the [P1](https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Bluetooth-Wireless-Measurements-Composition/dp/B07N1CLF9M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204028&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840151%2Fbest-smart-bathroom-scales%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and the [P2](https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including-Waterproof/dp/B09NJJ752J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204028&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840151%2Fbest-smart-bathroom-scales%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Priced at a surprisingly affordable point, this device provides a full-body analysis thanks to the 16 health measurements, including muscle and bone mass, body fat percentage, BMI, and standing heart rate.

 This waterproof scale is compatible with WiFi and Bluetooth and boasts third-party syncing to apps like [Apple Health](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-health/id1242545199), [Google Fit](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU204028/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US), and [Fitbit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbit-health-fitness/id462638897). When you consistently weigh in, you receive weekly full-body reports and can even check out a virtual avatar of yourself as you slim down or gain muscle, all of which are available in the accompanying app, [EufyLife](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eufylife/id1153481724).

 While it's a solid pick for everyday use, the brand specifies that it's not the best for professional athletes. You'll also want to be wary of when you decide to use this scale, as standing on it fresh out of the shower may slightly impact the health metrics.

#####  eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro

Our top pick for smart bathroom scales go to the P2 Pro from eufy, a solidly priced option with awesome features like 16 body metrics and real time body tracking.

| ✓ Simple design                      |                          |

 Stylish, affordable, and full of functionality, the [Xiaomi Mi Body Composition Scale 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD9F419?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204028&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840151%2Fbest-smart-bathroom-scales%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is hard to beat. The company has stumbled into [a few privacy concerns](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/04/30/exclusive-warning-over-chinese-mobile-giant-xiaomi-recording-millions-of-peoples-private-web-and-phone-use/?sh=52b6157e1b2a) regarding its phones, but this Wi-Fi-free product should alleviate some of your trepidation about the company.

 If you can look past those issues, you'll find the Mi Body Composition Scale 2 a well-rounded product. Not only does the scale look sleek, but it's packed with features to back up its futuristic appearance. All told, 13 metrics can be tracked, including body weight, BMI, muscle mass, and more. It can't, however, measure your heart rate---a feature typically found on [more expensive products](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/unlocking-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-lock-screen-3-foolproof-methods-that-actually-work-drfone-by-drfone-ios/).

 The smart scale can be used with the accompanying [smartphone app](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/zepp-life-formerly-mifit/id938688461) to record all your readings. This makes it easy to monitor your progress and is required for most of the advanced readings. The app is intuitive and quickly pairs with your smart scale through Bluetooth.

 It might lack a few features compared to other products on this list, but you're getting a lot of versatility for your money.

Best Budget Smart Scale

#####  Xiaomi Mi Body Composition Scale 2

The Xiomi Mi Body Composition Scale 2 can measure 13 different metrics, although heart rate isn't one of them. But considering its price tag, the omission is easy to overlook.

 Perhaps more simple in features than other options on our list, the [Withings Body+](https://www.amazon.com/Withings-Nokia-Body-Composition-smartphone/dp/B071XW4C5Q?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204028&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840151%2Fbest-smart-bathroom-scales%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) scale is an especially good pick if you want to lose weight. It provides multiple body composition measurements, such as BMI, body fat, and water percentage.

 Information automatically syncs to the accompanying app, [Health Mate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/withings-health-mate/id542701020). While the scale is compatible with third-party apps like [Apple Health](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-health/id1242545199), it won't automatically load your stats. That being said, other nice features are available on this scale, like daily weather and fitness activity information. You can also sync it with [MyFitnessPal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myfitnesspal-calorie-counter/id341232718), a free app that tracks your nutrition intake, so all of your fitness information is available in the same place.

 You can track the progress of up to eight users, and there are different modes to choose from, including pregnancy and baby.

 Although it's pricier than other scales in our roundup, [customers note](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PCBHAID0?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204028&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840151%2Fbest-smart-bathroom-scales%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that this scale is a good pick if you're looking to track basic health information.

| ✓ Weight limit of 400 pounds |                                         |

 At a little less than $70, the [Greater Goods Digital Smart Scale](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L19TY8X?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204028&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840151%2Fbest-smart-bathroom-scales%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) gives you great value for the price. It can track the progress of up to eight users, which is less than other options on our list, but if you're just planning to use it for individual or family use, it's a good option. Additionally, it does only measure six health metrics, but these include core measurements, such as bone mass, water weight, and body fat.

 There's a free in-house app ([Weight Gurus](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weight-gurus/id526207936)), but the [iOS App Store reviews](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weight-gurus/id526207936?see-all=reviews) aren't the best. It has a 2.9- out of 5-star rating and users noted that they had some issues with data syncing.

 That being said, you can use the scale with third-party fitness apps like [Fitbit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbit-health-fitness/id462638897) and [Google Fit](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU204028/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US). It also has a 400 pound weight limit and high-precision sensors that, according to the company, measure within 0.2 pounds.

## FAQ

### How accurate are smart scales?

 Smart scales can be very accurate when used properly. You'll need to follow specific instructions for each device (such as foot placement, only using with bare feet, etc.), but they tend to be just as accurate as their traditional counterparts---although there is a bit of variance depending on your product.

### How do smart scales measure body fat?

 Most smart scales use bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure body fat. This involves standing on small (painless) electrodes while barefoot to take the reading.

### Are smart scales worth it?

 If you're looking to track more than just your weight, investing in a smart scale is worth the price of admission. They're especially useful for folks actively monitoring their health, as they can take a wide variety of measurements.

### Are smart scales safe to use during pregnancy?

 This varies by product. Be sure to consult your physician along with the owner's manual to determine the safety of your smart scale.
