##  What to Look For in a 1080p Gaming Monitor in 2024

 Your hardware plays a significant role in your gaming experience. So, when shopping for a 1080p gaming monitor, you should focus on some key features to ensure you get the best for your needs.

 A monitor’s refresh rate is a critical feature to look for in your purchase. As 1080p monitors are relatively affordable, you can go for high-refresh-rate monitors. A 240Hz monitor will be the best option for most people, but if you have the budget and are into competitive gaming, you can also consider a 360Hz offering.

 Besides the refresh rate, your monitor should support VRR (variable refresh rate) so that you don’t encounter [screen tearing](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-preloaded-features-of-chatgpt-functions-and-implementation-tips/). While most good gaming monitors support [AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-leveraging-the-strengths-of-ez-grabber-software-for-2024/) to cater to the GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA, it’s a good idea to ensure that’s the case with your purchase. Intel GPU owners will want [DisplayPort Adaptive-Sync](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-meme-craftsmanship/) support. But if the monitor supports FreeSync and has a DisplayPort, it will also work with Intel GPUs.

 You also want the monitor to have a low input lag and excellent response time for a good experience. Any [IPS monitor](https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-great-debate-final-cut-pro-vs-lumafusion-for-video-editing/) will typically have good color accuracy in terms of image quality. But you can also check a monitor’s [sRGB](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-video-popularity-12-key-strategies-unveiled/) coverage, and getting one with 100% or wider coverage is better.

 Lastly, avoid monitors bigger than a 27-inch screen size, as the reduced pixel density will result in worse picture quality.

ViewSonic

| Pros                                 | Cons                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 240Hz refresh rate                   | Mediocre contrast ratio |
| Low input lag and fast response time | Not good for HDR        |
| FreeSync and G-Sync compatible       |                         |

 The [ViewSonic Omni XG2431](https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-XG2431-FreeSync-Ergonomics-DisplayPort/dp/B097S9SYM5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001463&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-1080p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a fantastic monitor to enjoy high refresh rate gaming. It supports a 240Hz refresh rate and has a 1080p display, so even if you don’t have an absolute top-end GPU, your PC will be able to drive high refresh rates. The screen size is 24 inches, which is big enough for a good experience but not so big that you can easily spot individual pixels.

 Another big highlight of the Omni XG2431 is superior motion handling. It’s tuned and [certified by Blur Busters](https://blurbusters.com/faq/120hz-monitors/), the folks behind the TestUFO tests. So you can rest easy knowing you won’t encounter any significant motion artifacts.

 In other features, the monitor supports AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync variable refresh rate technologies to reduce screen tearing. Additionally, it has Low Framerate Compensation (LFC) to ensure tear-free gaming even when the game frame rates drop too low.

 The ViewSonic offering has good build quality and is shipped with an ergonomic stand that supports everything from height adjustment to swivel. HDR support is also present, but it doesn’t have a wide [color gamut](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) or high [peak brightness](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-covert-videography-the-premier-8-downloader-list/) to offer a good HDR experience. Moreover, as the monitor uses an IPS panel, its contrast ratio is mediocre. But at least you get good color accuracy.

 In terms of the connectivity options, there are two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DisplayPort (DP) 1.4\. There is no USB-C, but you get two Type-A ports to connect peripherals or storage devices.

ASUS

| Pros                      | Cons                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 280Hz refresh rate        | High input lag at 60Hz |
| Excellent motion handling | Contrast is mediocre   |
| Good color accuracy       |                        |

 There is a lot to like about the 27-inch [ASUS TUF Gaming VG279QM](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-VG279QM-Compatible-DisplayHDR-DisplayPort/dp/B0845QFDVM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001463&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-1080p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) monitor. It delivers an impressive gaming performance thanks to features like a 280Hz refresh rate and low input lag. It’s also great at handling motion because of its fast response time and [black frame insertion (BFI)](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/the-full-breakdown-mastering-facetune-for-photo-enhancement-for-2024/) support.

 Plus, it uses an IPS panel, which is good for color accuracy and delivers respectable viewing angles. But as you can expect, the contrast ratio is mediocre, and there is no local dimming to help.

 You will be able to enjoy VRR regardless of your GPU manufacturer, as ASUS has included VESA's DisplayPort Adaptive-Sync and NVIDIA’s G-Sync. Although it’s not officially certified for FreeSync, it still offers VRR with AMD GPUs.

 In other features, you get a DP 1.2 and two HDMI 2.0 ports but no USB-C. Moreover, the single onboard Type-A port is only good for firmware updates. While [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) support is present, you won’t get a great experience because of the limited color gamut. Another drawback of the monitor is its [relatively higher input lag at a 60Hz refresh rate](https://www.techspot.com/review/2029-asus-tuf-gaming-vg279qm/).

 Beyond gaming, it’s suitable for office work and content creation, but you might want a higher-resolution monitor for that.

 The [Dell Alienware AW2523HF](https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW2523HF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability/dp/B0BDPCQ7PG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001463&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-1080p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a solid gaming monitor with a 360Hz refresh rate. As a result, you can enjoy ultra-high frame rates with your favorite gaming titles and an overall fluid experience. In addition to the game-changing refresh rate, the Dell monitor offers an incredible response time and excellent color accuracy thanks to its Fast IPS panel.

 Moreover, AMD FreeSync and VESA DisplayPort Adaptive-Sync ensure you get tear-free gaming regardless of the game’s frame rate. Even though the monitor isn’t officially certified by NVIDIA, it supports G-Sync VRR, but only while using a DisplayPort connection.

 The Alienware AW2523HF follows a gamer aesthetic on the design front, and the build quality is fantastic. You will also be happy with the included stand as it’s ergonomic. But if you want, you can mount it on a monitor arm using the built-in VESA mounting holes, like our other recommendations. Two HDMI 2.0 ports and one DP 1.4 are present for connectivity. And you get four USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports and two 3.5mm audio out jacks.

 Besides gaming, the Dell monitor is also suitable for office work and media consumption as long as you don’t have an issue with its 1080p resolution. Unfortunately, like other IPS monitors, its contrast ratio leaves much to be desired. And the monitor’s color gamut isn’t wide enough to deliver an impressive HDR experience.

| Pros                                                  | Cons              |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 360Hz refresh rate and low input lag                  | No HDR support    |
| Fast response time and customizable overdrive setting | Mediocre contrast |
| Support for FreeSync and G-Sync VRR technologies      |                   |

 The [BenQ Zowie XL2566K](https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-XL2566K-Monitor-XL-Setting-Adjustable/dp/B0B434LTLF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001463&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-1080p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a bit different from our other recommendations as it uses a [TN panel instead of an IPS](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-youtube-management-by-studio-techniques/). TN panels have traditionally been known to deliver impressive gaming performance because of their speedy response time. As a result, you will notice very little motion blur on the BenQ offering. It also has a high 360Hz refresh rate, enabling fluid motion. Plus, it supports VRR with AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

 One of the highlights of the monitor is the customizable overdrive setting that will let you adjust the monitor’s response time for any refresh rate. In other positives, the Zowie XL2566K has excellent color accuracy and decent peak brightness to combat glare and reflections.

 On the design front, the XL2566K is pretty basic. But the company includes an ergonomic stand and adjustable shields. You also get an S-Switch wired remote to access monitor options and settings quickly and easily.

 Port selection is limited to one DP 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports. So, you are out of luck if you want a built-in USB hub function to connect peripherals or storage devices. There is also no HDR support, and the BenQ monitor has a mediocre contrast ratio.

![Samsung Odyssey G4 Series](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/samsung-odyssey-g4-series.jpg) 

Samsung

| Pros                                        | Cons                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 240Hz refresh rate                          | G-Sync issues with HDMI connection |
| VRR support for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs         | Disappointing HDR performance      |
| Wide viewing angles and good color accuracy |                                    |

 The [Odyssey G4 from Samsung](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Compatible-DisplayPort-Adjustable-LS25BG402ENXGO/dp/B0B45998BM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001463&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-1080p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a gaming-oriented desktop monitor that packs everything you need for a good experience, from a high refresh rate to excellent motion handling. You also get a color-accurate IPS display with wide viewing angles, low input lag for responsive gaming, and support for VRR.

 The Odyssey monitor also packs some gaming-specific features, such as the ability to add a virtual crosshair and Ultrawide Game View Mode, which you won’t get on many other affordable monitors.

 Like our other recommendations, it lacks a USB-C port but includes one DP 1.2 and two HDMI 2.0 ports. There is also a 3.5mm audio jack but no Type-A USB ports. The G4 Series monitor also has a good build quality and an ergonomic stand, but the bundled stand takes quite a bit of space.

 You can buy the G4 Series in [25-inch](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Compatible-DisplayPort-Adjustable-LS25BG402ENXGO/dp/B0B45998BM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001463&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-1080p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [27-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-27-odyssey-fhd-ips-240hz-g-sync-gaming-monitor-black%2F6507926.p) screen sizes. However, the 27-inch size is exclusive to Best Buy in the United States. Unfortunately, NVIDIA G-Sync has [issues with HDMI connections](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/odyssey-g4-g40b-s27bg40#test%5F1425). So, you must use DisplayPort if you have an NVIDIA GPU. It’s also not the monitor to get if HDR is your priority.

## FAQ

### Which is better, a 1080p monitor or a 4K monitor?

 While a 4K monitor is technically better than a 1080 monitor, it [may not suit everyone](https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-innovating-visual-identity-with-ae-titles/). [4K monitors](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-top-five-transformative-facebook-traits/) typically cost more and require more processing power to drive them, particularly if they are using them to play games. That said, [4K monitors offer crisper visuals](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/onscreen-excellence-flexible-talent-access/) because of their higher resolution. But you should choose your monitor based on your use case and which resolution is the best for it.

### What is response time?

 A [monitor’s response time](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-jovial-jamboree-accessing-comic-crafts-for-free/) is the amount of time it takes for the display pixels to switch from one color to another. It’s typically measured by timing a pixel going from black to white to black in milliseconds. But you will also find gray-to-gray (GtG) and black-to-white measurements to show the response time. It can matter greatly during gaming as it impacts how a monitor handles motion. Poor response time can lead to [motion blur](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-finest-lineup-top-7-aim-focused-titles/) or [ghosting](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-your-video-presentation-with-these-7-free-makers/). So you want a monitor with a fast response time.

### What is VRR?

[VRR, or variable refresh rate](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), is a vital feature that allows a display to match its refresh rate to the frame rate of the content present on the screen. This helps avoid screen tearing and results in clean and smooth visuals.

### How do I clean my monitor?

 You can [clean your monitor](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/essential-steps-for-flawless-inshot-edits-for-2024/) using a soft, dry microfiber cloth. If there is a stain, you can spray some water on the cloth to help, but avoid using cleaning chemicals as they will damage any coating present on the screen.
