## Unbeatable Discounts: Secure Your Max Yearly Plan at a Massive 45% Savings – Limited Time Only!

Even though Warner Bros Discovery has taken some content off over the past few months, Max (formerly HBO Max) is still one of the best streaming services. Max is now running a deal on its yearly subscription, with discounts of up to 45% compared to the normal monthly prices.

 Max is currently offering [a discounted rate](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F) for all three of its yearly plans: Max with Ads, Max Ad-Free, and Max Ultimate Ad-Free. The Max with Ads plan is now $70 for the first year ($5.83/month), with support for two streams at once and 1080p resolution. The Ad-Free plan removes all advertisements and supports up to 30 offline downloads, at a price of $105 for the first year ($8.75/month). Finally, the Ultimate Ad-Free plan adds 4K streaming, a maximum of four streams at once, Dolby Atmos, and 100 offline downloads at $140 for the first year ($11.67/mo).

 The usual catch applies here: this will automatically renew after the first year at the non-discounted yearly price. If you grab one of these discounted plans, it might be a good idea to set a reminder for 11 months in the future, so you can decide if the then-current price is still worth the money before it automatically renews.

Max

 You can [sign up for the discounted plans](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F) from the Max website, no matter if you’re a new, returning, or existing subscriber. However, if you’re already in a yearly plan, you can only switch to another plan (no multi-year stacking, sorry). The deal is also available for new and returning subscribers through Google Play and Apple (in the Android and iPhone/iPad apps, respectively), and new subscribers on Amazon Fire.

 Max gives you access to many movies and shows in the Warner Bros Discovery media umbrella, including HBO series like _Game of Thrones_ and _Curb Your Enthusiasm_, Warner movies like _Wonka_, _Dune_, and The Batman, and Discovery shows like _Deadliest Catch_ and _Flip or Flop_. However, Warner has [removed some shows and movies over the past year](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/all-things-you-need-to-know-about-wipe-datafactory-reset-for-nokia-c22-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/) as cost-cutting measures.
