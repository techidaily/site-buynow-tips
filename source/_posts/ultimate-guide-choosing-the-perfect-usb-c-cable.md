##  What to Look For in a USB-C Cable in 2023

 It's easy to shop around and simply find a cable labeled [USB-C](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-lenovo-screen-capture-tools-effortlessly/), but finding the right cable to suit your needs can be a bit more complicated than that. Oftentimes, a random USB-C cable might be too long, too short, not durable enough, not versatile enough, and might not even support fast charging.

 Durability is a huge factor as it's the driving force behind the endurance of your investment. Meanwhile, ensuring your USB-C cable supports the recharge and data speeds of your devices is also important since it can greatly hinder your experience if it doesn't.

 Then there are more general qualities like the length. Some USB-C cables might be long, but won't be high quality and begin to slow or fray over time. Shorter cables are generally more durable, but that isn't always a hard rule. It's important to shop for a higher-end cable no matter the length, as the small increase in price will get you a cable that lasts much, much longer.

 Below, we've listed a handful of USB-C cables that can accommodate anyone's needs or budget.

 Anker has been making cables for many years now, and the [New Nylon USB-C to USB-C Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-MacBook-Galaxy-Charger/dp/B088NRLMPV?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a perfect pick for anyone who needs the "ol' reliable" of USB-C cables.

 Using nylon for its construction and aluminum for extra durability, this cable won't be fraying anytime soon. It comes in either [3.3 feet](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-MacBook-Galaxy-Charger/dp/B088NMR44C?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [six feet](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charging-MacBook-Galaxy-Charger/dp/B088NRLMPV?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) lengths depending on your needs, and the package comes with two cables, which makes this a great value.

 Anker also made sure to equip the cord with [Power Delivery](https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd), providing support for up to 60W fast charging on supported devices.

 The only real downside is the cable's lack of support for connecting to an external display over USB, but for those who simply need a USB-C cable for charging and data transfer, you can't go wrong with this option.

 However, for just under $8, you really can't go wrong if all you need is a basic way to power up your device or manage files between your phone and laptop.

 It's common knowledge in the world of cables that the longer you go, the slower the cable gets at charging and data transfers. Some companies have been able to hack this general consensus by implementing high-end technologies to ensure nothing gets bogged down due to extra length, and Grtoeud has done just that.

 Its [USB-C cable](https://www.amazon.com/Type-Charging-Charger-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B08P4D7QPQ?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers a durable nylon design with reinforced tips and a tangle-free finish. Grtoeud says the cord supports Power Delivery thanks to a special E-Mark chip. This chip grants you up to 100W charging, so you shouldn't experience any slowdowns regardless of the device you connect. The cable is available in [10 feet](https://www.amazon.com/Type-Charging-Charger-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B08FRLY584?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [15 feet](https://www.amazon.com/Type-Charging-Charger-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B08P4D7QPQ?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [20 feet](https://www.amazon.com/Type-Charging-Charger-MacBook-Samsung/dp/B091GJ288S?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) sizes to suit your needs.

 Once you get up to 20 feet, you'll be paying $25 which is a bit pricey for a USB-C cable, but in exchange, you'll get a long cord with good durability and performance. At the end of the day, if what you're after is a long USB-C cable, that ought to fit the mold perfectly.

 If you need a cable with added versatility, you'll want to pick up [Spigen's DuraSync 3 in 1 Universal Charger Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-DuraSync-Charging-Certified-Lightning/dp/B07DHM9JZW?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). This cord has three interchangeable connectors that support USB-C, Lightning, and [micro USB](https://www.reviewgeek.com/53587/usb-explained-all-the-different-types-and-what-theyre-used-for/) to charge all of your devices while on the go.

 It comes with a nylon finish for durability, has Made for iPhone certification, and supports Quick Charge 3.0 so long as you have a compatible adapter. It's also fairly priced at $18.

 The biggest downside is the fact it only supports a USB-A connection on the opposite end. That being said, if you want an all-in-one solution in your next USB-C cable purchase, this is the one to get.

 When connecting Thunderbolt-compatible devices to your computer, you need a high-quality cable. You want to ensure you take full advantage of Thunderbolt 4's high data transfer, power, and video signal capabilities. And for that, there are few better options than the [Belkin Thunderbolt 4 cable](https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Certified-Thunderbolt-Connection-Compatible/dp/B09PQ9ZHCV?tag=htg-v2-768svlj-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207924&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F768524%2Fbest-usb-c-cable%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The sturdy but flexible cable is available in 1m and 2m lengths. The 2m cable is considerably more expensive as it is [active](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-the-world-of-fb-video-content-production/) rather than passive, as is often the case with longer Thunderbolt cables. That's due to the transmitters at either end of an active cable, designed to ensure no loss of speed when data has a longer distance to travel.

 The Belkin cable is compliant with [USB4](https://location-social.techidaily.com/why-your-whatsapp-location-is-not-updating-and-how-to-fix-on-apple-iphone-xs-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) and backwardly compatible with Thunderbolt 3\. It also supports USB 3.2 and USB 2.0\. Just like the previous version, Thunderbolt 4 uses [USB-C connectors](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-safest-drone-selections-5-great-options-for-young-ones/) and ports. This makes it usable with many more devices than the first two versions of the technology.

 This isn't a cheap cable, but it isn't expensive either. Especially if you only need the 1m passive cable, not the more costly active version. For this type of cable, which carries power, data, and up to a 4K video signal, it makes sense to prioritize quality over price. You can find cheaper Thunderbolt 4 cables from less well-respected brands, but do you really want to?

## FAQ

### Are all USB-C cables the same?

 While all USB-C cables have the same connector, they are not the same. Some might connect USB-C devices to non USB-C devices (like those with USB-A or Lightning ports), and different USB-C cables will have different data transfer and charging speeds. Even the length of a cable can affect how a USB-C cable can perform.

### What uses a USB-C cable?

 Since USB-C ports are relatively standardized, many devices can use a USB-C cable. Some of the most notable devices include modern [Android phones](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/), all [iPads](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-screen-content-on-huawei-mate-10-20-and-p-series-phones-via-built-in-recorders/) except the 9th generation standard model, most of the latest [Kindle](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/superior-10-mobile-apps-to-edit-your-face/) models, and [game controllers](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-computer-components-with-toms-gear-guides/).

### What is a USB-C to Lightning cable?

 A USB-C to [Lightning](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-6-virtual-reality-vr-gloves-to-check-out/) cable has the USB-C connector on one end and the Lightning connector (commonly used with Apple products) on the other end. These wires are most commonly used to connect an iPhone to a wall charger for fast charging.

### What is a USB-C to USB-C cable used for?

 A USB-C to USB-C cable has the USB-C connector on both ends of the wire. You can use this cable to connect two devices with that connector together. The most common use is to connect a smartphone to a wall charger.

### Can all USB-C cables do fast charging?

 No. While a majority of USB-C cables do support fast charging, not all of them do. In addition, USB-C cables that do support fast charging will support different speeds. Make sure that the USB-C cable you're looking to buy supports fast charging, and supports it at the speed you want it at.

### Can I use a USB-C cable with my iPhone?

 With the [iPhone 15](https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-sound-strategies-tailoring-your-microphone-to-align-with-your-youtube-channel/) models, you can now use USB-C cables to charge your iPhone. If you have any previous iPhone model, however, you will still need a [Lightning cable](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-6-virtual-reality-vr-gloves-to-check-out/).
