## Smart Blinds and 2023, Which Are Relevant to the Original Title, While Adding Value with Additional Descriptive Words Like Top-Rated, Comprehensive Guide, and Ultimate Selection.

Smart blinds allow you to control your blinds easily using a companion app or smart home hub. You can set a schedule to make your blinds open and close automatically or control them manually from anywhere. Smart blinds can make your home more energy efficient, too.

##  What to Look For in Smart Blinds in 2023

 If you want to make your home smarter, [smart blinds are worth the investment](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-design-a-post-that-sparks-wide-scale-interest-in-fb-giving/), and not just for convenience. Being able to control your blinds from anywhere, even when you aren't home, helps a lot if you need to open or close them at specific times—whether for children or pets—or to give the illusion that you're home to deter thieves.

 But, when looking for smart blinds, there are some things you should keep an eye out for. The first and most important is the style of the blind you're purchasing. Smart blinds come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and types. This includes roller blinds, slatted blinds, honeycomb-style blinds, vertical blinds, and more. Before narrowing the feature list, you should ensure the blinds you purchase are the right size and style for your home.

 When it comes to [smart blind features](https://windows11.techidaily.com/tailored-keyboard-magic-custom-shortcuts-w11-style/), there are a few factors to consider. Do you need blackout filtering to completely darken a room? Are you looking to make life easier by purchasing smart blinds with voice assistant support? Do you prefer your blinds to be hardwired, battery-powered, or solar-powered?

 Depending on the brand, you may have to sacrifice some features to prioritize others. It's also worth considering whether you need to make additional purchases for certain features to work. Many smart blinds will allow you to use voice assistants but will require a bridge or hub that is sold separately.

 The final aspect of smart blinds to ponder is installation. If you're retrofitting existing blinds or curtains with a smart blind kit, you can install them yourself. However, hardwired or smart blinds that cover large areas may require additional assistance—sometimes even professional installation, which will be an additional charge.

 Once you know what you need out of your smart blinds, you can make your purchase with confidence, especially if you go with one of our recommendations below.

| Can be controlled via the IKEA Home app |                                                                |

 Coming in various sizes and options, the [IKEA FYRTUR](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/fyrtur-block-out-roller-blind-w-hub-kit-gray-s49499253/) smart blinds are some of the most versatile you can buy on the market. These blinds range from 58.5x195cm to 122x195cm, and you can bundle them with the necessary [DIRIGERA hub](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/dirigera-hub-for-smart-products-white-smart-50503414/) if you don't have one already.

 Versatility aside, the ability to block out sunlight completely makes these smart blinds especially great. If you work at night and need to sleep during the day or need help regulating a child's sleep patterns, these blinds will be a great purchase.

 If you already have the IKEA [TRETUR](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tretur-black-out-roller-blind-light-gray-80380464/) or FYRTUR roller blinds installed in your home, you'll be pleased to know that the walls and ceiling brackets for those are suitable across all of these models—another nod to IKEA's way of making life easier.

 Once installed and connected, the IKEA FYRTUR smart blinds are a breeze to use. You can manually open and close the blinds, control them at a distance using the included remote control, or even wirelessly via the IKEA Home smart 1 app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU202703/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ikea.tradfri.lighting) or [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ikea-home-smart-1/id1195836071). With the DIRIGERA hub or TRÅDFRI gateway, you can also use voice controls with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple HomeKit to control your blinds.

 If you're looking for smart blinds that can do nearly everything you'd want them to, the IKEA FYRTUR blinds should be your first look.

 A Group Control feature lets you simultaneously control up to four different blinds with a single button. This is super helpful if you have a large space with different setups. It's also photo-sensitive; you can program it to open or close based on lighting conditions.

 Most SwitchBot devices can be voice-controlled and used hands-free with voice assistants and smart devices via the SwitchBot Hub Mini. If you're looking for an affordable way to upgrade your existing blinds, the SwitchBot Blind Tilt Motorized Blinds is the way to go.

| Pros                             | Cons                              |

| Works with many smart assistants | More expensive than other options |
| Smart lighting integration       |                                   |

 The [Serena Smart Shades](https://www.serenashades.com/) allow you to create a comfortable space in your home that you can control via a remote, the Lutron app on [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lutron-app/id886753021) and [Android](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lutron-app/id886753021), or voice assistant. There are multiple styles of shade to choose from, and with hundreds of fabrics and colors available, you can find Serena shades that suit any home.

 While the Serena smart shades are undoubtedly more expensive than most of our other recommendations, they are made to be a perfect fit for your window. Plus, you can combine this with professional installation in your area so you know the blinds are installed perfectly.

 Once installed, the Serena blinds can connect to most smart home ecosystems, including Alexa, Google Assistant, SONOS, SmartThings, Apple HomeKit, and Lutron's Caséta. You can use your existing [smart home](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-masterpiece-in-motion-capture-sonys-x1000-action-gear/) products, like [smart displays](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-comprehensive-overview-of-multiscreen-streaming-techniques-on-social-media-platforms-like-facebook/), to easily control the blinds.

 Using the Lutron app, you can set schedules to make your blinds open and close automatically at specific times or create scenes that integrate with your other smart devices. You can let the light in and have your blinds open on time every morning, then have them close at night without any manual intervention.

 The only additional consideration you might need is whether or not to invest in the [Lutron Smart Hub](https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/expansion-kits-and-smart-bridge). This separate purchase unlocks features like voice control, light optimization, and scheduling.

 Easy to install, [MySmartBlinds](https://www.smarterhome.com/products/mysmartblinds) comes in a range of neutral colors to complement your home's decor. You can purchase these with or without smart motorization; however, if you want to go down the smart route, it will cost you extra.

 MySmartBlinds are compatible with window frames 21 to 73 inches wide and 120 inches tall and frames with a depth equal to or greater than 2.5 inches. This makes them a versatile choice, with each blind including a SmartLock mounting system, tilt wand, and solar panel.

 One of the standout features of MySmartBlinds is that there is no need to plug these smart blinds into a power outlet. Thanks to the included solar panel, your blinds will charge up in the sunlight, so you can install them without worrying about the battery running dry.

 Using the [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysmartblinds/id1042778784) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU202703/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mysmartblinds2.android&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) app, you control MySmartBlinds directly from your smartphone. You can set schedules so that your blinds open and close at set times and even open them automatically using Sun Tracking mode. With the onboard motor and memory, your schedules and automation are initiated even if you're not home.

 To use voice commands, you will need to purchase the [Tilt Bridge](https://www.smarterhome.com/products/smart-hub) separately. While this is a bit disappointing, it's hard to dislike MySmartBlinds since they are so easy to install, thanks to the SmartLock technology.

 If you're confident with a little DIY and don't want to shell out on brand-new smart blinds, the [MySmartBlinds Automation Kit](https://www.smarterhome.com/products/mysmartblinds-automation-kit) makes it easy to retrofit existing blinds. This Bluetooth-enabled kit comes with a solar panel, much like the standard MySmartBlinds, so you can keep your blinds charged using the sun. In other words, no tangled wires and no potential hazards to trip over.

 The MySmartBlinds Automation Kit is designed to fit most 2 to 2.5-inch horizontal blinds. The included solar panel can easily be fitted to the blinds using the adjustable clips provided, and the adhesive backing on the manual control switch makes it simple to install. If you still want to be able to control your blinds manually, there's a hook that allows you to attach your blind's tilt wand without fuss.

 Using the [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysmartblinds/id1042778784) or [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU202703/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mysmartblinds2.android&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) app, you can set personalized schedules to tilt blinds open and close at certain times or days of the week. Adding new events via the app, editing existing schedules, or enabling energy savings is easy. You can even name individual rooms and group your blinds for added convenience.

 Like MySmartBlinds, the MySmartBlinds Automation Kit works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. However, this is only possible with the additional purchase of the [Tilt Bridge](https://www.smarterhome.com/products/smart-hub), as it's not included in the kit. But, if you're happy enough with the app, spending extra is unnecessary if you don't really need it.

## FAQ

### How do smart blinds work?

 Smart blinds work by connecting via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth with your smart devices. Once connected, you'll be able to control different settings and features via an app or voice control. For example, you can set schedules, open/close your blinds, etc.

### Can you make your current blinds smart?

 You can make your current blinds smart by using a smart blind kit. These are usually small devices that attach to your normal blinds and have a wireless connection (like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) built-in to them.

### How do I install smart blinds?

 Smart blinds tend not to be very different from normal blinds when it comes to installation. Like traditional blinds, some smart blinds will be cut to size, whereas others will come with set dimensions. Once installed, your smart blinds will need to connect to another Wi-Fi or Bluetooth-enabled device like your smartphone in order to use the smart features.
