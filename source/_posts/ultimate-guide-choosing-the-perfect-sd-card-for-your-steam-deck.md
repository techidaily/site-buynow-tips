## Ultimate Guide: Choosing the Perfect SD Card for Your Steam Deck

###### [Read update](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-iphone-se-2022-blacklist-removal-tips-and-tools-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) 

* We've reviewed our recommendations and these are still the best SD cards you can buy for the Steam Deck.

 Steam Deck doesn't offer a ton of built-in storage, and that's especially true of the entry-level model. Expand your library and keep loading speeds fast with a good SD card.

###  UPDATE: 01/25/2024

 We've reviewed our recommendations and these are still the best SD cards you can buy for the Steam Deck.

 Valve offers [a variety of Steam Deck models](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck), but most of them are severely lacking in storage. Opting for the base model will only get you 64GB---which is barely enough to hold a few indie titles. Thankfully, Valve allows you to expand your gaming library with microSD cards. This makes it easy to quickly beef up the handheld's storage capacity, though there are a few factors to consider before picking up the cheapest one on Amazon.

 The most important factor to consider is speed. Steam Deck supports transfer rates up to 100MB/s, so be sure your SD card hits this target. There's nothing wrong with going above this limit, although Steam Deck is built to support only UHS-I cards, meaning you won't see much of a performance boost above 100MB/s. Go below this, however, and you'll experience long loading times and decreased performance.

 Reliability is the other factor that's truly important when shopping for Steam Deck SD cards. Companies like SanDisk, Samsung, and Lexar have been creating powerful SD cards for years, so you can rest easy knowing your files will be safe. Steer clear of knockoff brands that you've never heard of, as these could become corrupted and cause issues for you down the line.

 Beyond reliability and speed, you'll just need to determine which size card is best for your gaming library. Indie games take up much less space than blockbusters like God of War. If you intend to hold tons of demanding games on your Steam Deck, springing for a 1TB SD card is a good option. But if you're just going to be playing _Stardew Valley_, _Celeste_, and other hit indies, you might be able to get away with something much smaller. A card that's 256GB tends to offer the best combination of pricing and size.

 With that in mind, here's a look at the five best Steam Deck SD cards available today.

![Sandisk Extreme pro on blue and green background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/snadisk-extreme-pro.jpg) 

_SanDisk_

| Pros                 | Cons                |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| ✓ Fast loading times | ✗ Might be overkill |
| ✓ Reasonable price   |                     |
| ✓ Extremely durable  |                     |

 SanDisk is responsible for some of the best SD cards currently available, so it should be no surprise that its premium [Extreme Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G3JCG8Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) lineup is the best option for Steam Deck. Along with the reliability that SanDisk is known for, the Extreme Pro offers impressive read and write speeds, making it a great fit for gaming on Valve's handheld.

 The Extreme Pro is built with transfer rates up to 170MB/s, which is well above the 100MB/s that Steam Deck can produce. In other words, the speed is absolutely overkill for Steam Deck—you'll never have to worry about slow speeds again.

 SanDisk also built the Extreme Pro to be durable, useful when traveling with Steam Deck. From water and X-rays to high temperatures and accidental drops, this card can handle it all.

 Despite all these features, pricing is fairly reasonable for all models of the Extreme Pro, with a [128GB model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G3H5RBT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) regularly available for just $20\. We'd recommend springing for at least the [256GB model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G3JCG8Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and a [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-microSDXC-Extreme-Adapter-Mobile/dp/B07RKL6PK9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) version is even available if you have dozens of games you want to bring on the road.

 With stats well beyond Steam Deck's limits, the Extreme Pro lets you play games without worrying about slow transfer rates. It's also remarkably durable, making it a great travel companion.

| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Great price                   | ✗ Larger models are much more expensive |
| ✓ Fully supported by Steam Deck |                                         |
| ✓ Models available up to 1TB    |                                         |

 It's not as fast as the Extreme Pro, but the [SanDisk Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NV73PJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the perfect SD card for frugal shoppers. With a [256GB model](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NV73PJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that's regularly available for just $20, this is an easy way to boost your Steam Deck storage capacity without emptying your wallet.

 The Ultra carries a UHS-I rating, allowing Steam Deck to run at its fastest possible speeds. And like most SanDisk products, this one is fully supported by a wide range of other products (such as cameras, smartphones, and tablets), so you can easily swap it to other devices if you ever upgrade to a better Steam Deck card.

 While the lower-range cards are affordable, you'll still spend around $100 for a [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NYN3N3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) model. At that price, it might be better to consider other models on this list, which are a bit more robust yet not much more expensive. But if you stick to the [128GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NTY2S6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NV73PJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or [512GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NVXLLM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models, the Ultra is a great option.

Best Budget SD Card for Steam Deck

#####  SanDisk Ultra

The SanDisk Ultra may not be as fast as others on this list, but it still meets the requirements of Steam Deck. It's also dirt cheap, although the larger models can quickly become expensive.

[See at amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NV73PJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

_SanDisk_

| Pros                         | Cons                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✓ Read speeds up to 190MB/s  | ✗ Not the fastest card on the market |
| ✓ Write speeds up to 130MB/s |                                      |
| ✓ Models up to 1TB           |                                      |

 The [SanDisk Extreme](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-dp-B09X7CRKRZ/dp/B09X7CRKRZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is fast. With transfer speeds up to 190MB/s, you'll benefit from load times similar to games stored on Steam Deck's built-in storage. It's also reasonably priced, with its [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-dp-B09X7CRKRZ/dp/B09X7CRKRZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) model commonly offered for around $20, and carries an A2 rating (which means you'll see faster reading and writing times than lesser cards).

 This isn't the fastest card on the market (some newer products get over 200MB/s), but the 190MB/s offered by the Extreme is more than Steam Deck can utilize. You'll also benefit from impressive durability and longevity, making it a wise investment that should last just as long as your Steam Deck.

 Toss in the option to choose from various sizes ([128GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-dp-B09X7BK27V/dp/B09X7CRKRZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-dp-B09X7CRKRZ/dp/B09X7CRKRZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [512GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-dp-B09X7CRKRZ/dp/B09X7C2GBC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter-dp-B09X7CRKRZ/dp/B09X7MPX8L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)), and you've got a compelling product. Loading games, installing games, and moving around files is no challenge for the SanDisk Extreme, and it's an easy recommendation for anyone seeking a lightning-fast SD card for their handheld.

_Samsung_

| Pros                           | Cons                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| ✓ Samsung reliability          | ✗ 256GB might be too small |
| ✓ Transfer rates up to 130MB/s |                            |
| ✓ 10-year limited warranty     |                            |

 You can find many SD cards for less than $25, but few are as impressive as the [Samsung Evo Select](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Adapter-microSDXC-MB-ME512KA-AM/dp/B09B1GXM16?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). With the [256GB](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Adapter-microSDXC-MB-ME512KA-AM/dp/B09B1GXM16?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) version clocking in at just $20, you get everything you need to expand your Steam Deck library without an inflated price.

 As expected, this is built with specs that meet or exceed everything the Steam Deck requires. This includes a UHS-I classification and transfer speeds up to 130MB/s. So whether you're playing a lightweight indie or beefy blockbuster, they'll benefit from fast load times when stored on the Evo Select.

 This SD card is also surprisingly durable. Like our top pick, Samsung designed this card to handle extreme temperatures, water, x-rays, magnets, and accidental drops. Toss in a 10-year limited warranty, and it's clear the Evo Select is a reliable choice.

 If you need more space, consider jumping to the [512GB model](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Adapter-microSDXC-MB-ME512KA-AM/dp/B09B1HMJ9Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU228056&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F898775%2Fthe-best-sd-cards-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which can frequently be found for $40 and should give you more freedom when deciding which games to keep on your device.
