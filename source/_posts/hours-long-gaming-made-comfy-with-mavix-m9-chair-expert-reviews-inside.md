 _Mavix provided us with a review unit for one of our writers to test. Read on for their full take._

 Long hours of gaming can mean sitting slouched over a desk, staring at a gaming[monitor.](https://www.lifewire.com/best-computer-monitors-to-buy-4061369) While it’s easy to remember ergonomics for say, a keyboard or a mouse, it’s easy to forget arguably the most important piece of any home setup is actually your chair.

 A poor computer chair may lead to backaches, pains, and a whole mess of skeletal and muscular issues. When I began to have these symptoms, I decided it was time for a change to my chair, and got the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair for review. After over 20 hours of testing, it’s safe to say that I’ve found my favorite piece of gaming equipment.

## Design: A gamer’s dream

 The M9 comes in four different color options, but to play it safe with my pets, I chose to get it in the sleek black option. In fact, those with pets will want to take note, as my first impression of the chair was that while most of it was black leather, the Dynamic Variable Lumbar support consisted of multilayered nylon, mesh material. It’s great for gamers’ backs—but can collect pet hair if your furry friends decide the M9 is a great place to snooze.

 Despite this mesh exterior, the M9 chair is incredibly sleek and modern and adds style to any modern gaming setup. This is not only because of the mesh support but the rest of the chair is upholstered in beautiful, smooth leather. The logo on the headrest stands out, but it’s not really a detriment to the overall design of the chair.

 At 56 x 26 x 22.75 inches (HWD), the chair has a wide seat for spreading out and comes with an optional headrest. Even the wheels are prepped for hours of gameplay and come with a locking feature to ensure stability.

## Comfort: It’s all in the ergonomics

 It would be an understatement to say that the M9 Chair offers adjustability. In fact, nearly everything can be adjusted from the seat depth to the headrest angle—the chair is easy to mold to your personal needs.

 Coupled with the standard plush foam on the seat, the M9 really molds to your shape once you get everything adjusted. That said, it’s imperative that you don’t miss this crucial step—it can mean the difference between hours of comfort and fast onsetting discomfort. But, once I got everything set up to my body type, my back was thrilled with the change from my old chair.

## Performance and Usage: Amazing day-to-day

 Admittedly, I’m a repeat offender for the slouched-over-the-computer look and have been for years. However, for the first time in a really long time, the M9 Chair made me want to lean back—and straighten my posture.

 I’m not saying this chair is the cure to back issues, but it definitely helped improve my posture while using the computer.

 I really can’t pinpoint why I began sitting straighter while using the M9, but with this chair and its ergonomic back support, not only did my back aches lessen, they stopped. I’m not saying this chair is the cure to back issues, but it definitely helped improve my posture while using the computer.

 Another great feature of the M9 chair is that the wheel lock. My work setup and[gaming rig](https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-pcs-4045451) are set up in a room with original hardwood floors. Most chairs with wheels try to go for a solo ride on the smooth floor. With the wheel lock, you won’t have to worry about accidentally nudging your chair away from the desk during that critical boss battle.

 And even better, if you decide that a nap is in order but you’d prefer not to move, you can invoke the M9’s Extended Recline, which allows the chair to recline up to 127 degrees. If you’re feeling a nap, it’s great. Personally, using the entirety of the 127 degrees made me a little nervous, but the good news is that the degree recline is also adjustable.

 Only want to go back a few degrees? You can adjust that thanks to the levers underneath the chair seat. This feature also helped relieve my back when I started feeling like I’d been sitting in the chair too long. It’s a great, relaxing addition.

## Price: Hits the wallet hard

 For the price of $1,000, the Mavix M9 chair can be yours. That’s a lot of money to invest in a chair, especially when most places will charge a fraction of that for a desk chair. This isn’t just a desk chair, however—this is an ergonomic gamer’s chair, and as such, it’s designed to make gaming comfortable and easy. So, while it seems like a lot of money, realistically, you’re paying for a plethora of adjustability options, and ergonomics.

## Mavix M9 vs. XChair X4 Chair

 While the M9 is the most expensive option available in a series of gaming chairs from Mavix, the X4 Executive Office Chair by XChair is the highest tier office chair. So, it makes sense to compare them since they’re both geared for the work and play setting. Their prices are different, with the X4 costing around $1,200 before adding customizable options.

 That’s where the differences come in though. While the M9 may seem like the ideal choice, especially when it comes to cost, the key word here is customization. The M9 comes with similar features to the X4 chair, however, most aren’t as customizable on the M9\. The X4 offers color customization, wheel upgrades, and even different foam options for the seat. If you’re looking for a fancy upgrade for your office chair, then the X4 Chair may be better suited to your interests. However, if you want a great gaming chair without extras like memory foam, the M9 will suit your needs just fine.

 Final Verdict

**A great gaming chair for all-day use.**

 While it can’t really be customized outside of cosmetic options, the M9 gaming chair is a solid, easy way to enjoy any gaming hobby without worrying about backaches. The reclining technology and the locking wheels are especially nice bonuses. The price may seem a little high, but it’s a worthy investment for any gamer.
