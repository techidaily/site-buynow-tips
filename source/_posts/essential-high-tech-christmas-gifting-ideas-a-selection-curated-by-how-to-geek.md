##  Best Tech Gifts for Movie-Lovers

 A good movie is a hard thing to beat. While it's hard to replicate the experience of seeing something in a movie theater, that doesn't mean a movie night at home has to be a drag. Plus, there are a lot of luxuries you can have at home that aren't allowed in a cinema.

 Whether you're looking to buy for your other half, your kids, or just someone else who loves movies, we've got you covered with some of the best gifts around. From neat tech to audio options that'll make movies sound great, there are plenty of unique gifts to be had.

 Let's jump in, shall we?

##  West Bend Popcorn Machine: The Party is Popping Off

![Stir Crazy popcorn machine on table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/west-band-popcorn-maker.jpg) 

West Bend

 Everyone knows that the first thing you need when planning a movie night is good snacks.

 It's also a well-known fact that no movie is complete without popcorn, and that's why we're here to talk about the [West Bend Popcorn Machine](https://www.amazon.com/82505-Electric-Popcorn-Stirring-Convenient/dp/B00KL8SM92?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). This little cooker can pop popcorn like you wouldn't believe, thanks to a stir rod that keeps the unpopped corn moving around the heated plate to help it all get cooked.

 Plus, the lid doubles as a serving bowl, so your giftee can save on dishes as well.

 This device works a bit like a [Nespresso machine](https://www.amazon.com/Nespresso-VertuoPlus-Coffee-Espresso-DeLonghi/dp/B01N7GO468?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), with the user only needing to insert a cocktail capsule into it, make sure there is enough spirit in the appropriate reservoirs, and then enjoy the drink that comes out of it.

 It can make a lot of different drinks, too; all the user needs [are the right capsules](https://www.amazon.com/Bartesian-Classic-Collection-Cocktail-Capsules/dp/B07XQBRWCC/ref=psdc%5F14808787011%5Ft1%5FB07PJ5Q943?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

##  Bose TV Speaker: Powerful Sound

![Bose soundbar on table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bose-tv-soundbar.jpg) 

Bose

 Soundbars aren't a new type of tech, but they're getting more popular as they're becoming more affordable.

 If you're looking to buy one for someone you love, then the [Bose TV Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Speaker-Soundbar-Bluetooth-connectivity/dp/B088KRPCQJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is an excellent choice.

#####  Bose TV Speaker

[$199 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Speaker-Soundbar-Bluetooth-connectivity/dp/B088KRPCQJ) [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbose__tv_speaker_blu%2F6416849.p%3FskuId%3D6416849) [Target](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F156932%2F564546%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUhtgUeUpU208157%26subId2%3Dehtg%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.target.com%252Fp%252Fbose%255Ftv%255Fspeaker%255Fblue%252F-%252FA-79829337) 

##  Roku Streaming Stick 4K+: Small But Powerful Streaming

![Roku streaming stick 4k on table with coffee](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/roku-streaming-stick-4K.jpg) 

Roku

 Many people nowadays tend to watch movies via streaming services rather than owning Blu-Rays and [Ultra HD](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-oppo-a78-5g-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/) disks. Even if your giftee is the type to prefer physical media, they probably still use streaming services to watch films they don't own.

 The [Roku Streaming Stick 4K+](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCQYRN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is the latest in the Roku range, and it offers a tiny little dongle that grants easy access to all of the [best streaming services](https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/). Along with an upgraded streaming connection, the new Streaming Stick 4K+ features a rechargeable remote that allows users to control the device with their voice, all for a more than reasonable price.

![51iDlfVj8FL._SL500_-4](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51idlfvj8fl-_sl500_-4.jpg) 

#####  Roku Streaming Stick 4K+

A tiny streaming dongle designed for ease of use with the simple Roku OS system.

[$75 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCQYRN) [Crutchfield](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crutchfield.com%2FI-rNARc1DWT%2Fp_4213821R%2FRoku-3821R-Streaming-Stick-4K.html) 

##  Apple TV 4K: Not Just Ted Lasso

![Apple TV 4K on pink background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-tv-4k.jpg) 

Apple

 Not every movie night specifically revolves around movies anymore. A night-in could likely be spent binge-watching or catching up on TV that has been missed.

 The [2021 Apple TV 4K](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0933D3SN6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is an excellent streaming device that allows the user to browse services like [Disney+](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-top-ways-to-resolve-apple-id-not-active-issue-for-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-ios/), [HBO Max](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/mediameld-editsuite/), and more. Not only that, but it also grants access to the Apple TV service too, which is home to some excellent shows.

 The most appealing thing here, though, is that it grants access to Apple's array of services. That means Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, and more can all be used with the streaming device. Since those services are generally exclusive to the Apple ecosystem, that's a big bonus for the Apple TV 4K.

 Sure, that's not all just for movie nights, but it's a nice bonus.

#####  2021 Apple TV 4K

Apple TV is rapidly becoming a fantastic streaming service. This little box grants access to that and so much more.

There are many ways to do this, but few are as all-inclusive and straightforward as the [Philips Hue Smart Bulb](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095KSZQGD?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 These are smart bulbs, easily controlled via the [Hue app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208157/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/apps/bridge) or whatever smart home hub your movie-lover has at home.

![optoma projector on grey background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/optoma-projector.jpg)

 Projectors are a bit of a luxury item, but that means they make a fantastic gift.

 The [Optoma Home Theater Projector](https://www.amazon.com/Optoma-Projector-Compatible-Enhanced-High-Bright/dp/B084TSNVRJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208157&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F764314%2Fbest-gifts-for-movie-lovers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) features 1080p projection but allows for 4k input, which means the image will look fantastic even at the standard resolution.
