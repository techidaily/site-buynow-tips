## Enhance PlayStation 5 Performance & Connectivity Through Discord Syncing

Discord is one of the most popular messaging and chat apps around. The company attempted to pivot as a general-use messaging app for a while, but it was conceived as a gaming app, helping millions of gamers stay connected during sessions. Now, Discord online voice chatting is coming to the PlayStation 5 natively.

 Discord voice chat has been integrated directly into the PlayStation 5 console, eliminating the need for mobile devices. With this new integration, PlayStation 5 users can seamlessly connect with their friends on Discord, regardless of whether they are using the desktop app, mobile app, or other gaming consoles. [Discord integration in the console](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-discover-the-top-8-android-platforms-for-large-gatherings/) is nothing new, but you can finally join voice chats now. If you're playing an online game, especially if it's a cross-platform game, you can just connect to your online chat of choice in whatever server you want, and it'll work just like if you were connecting through another platform. This allows you to communicate with your cross-platform squad while gaming or simply share thoughts and ideas with friends.

 To join a Discord call on your PlayStation 5, ensure your PlayStation Network account is linked to Discord. If not, [follow the instructions provided by Discord](https://discord.com/blog/playstation-5-voice-integration-announcement#heading-2) to link the accounts. Once linked, you can join calls directly through the console's Game Base menu, without the need for a mobile device. Just press the PlayStation button, navigate to Game Base, select "Discord", choose a server or DM, and join the voice channel. Alternatively, you can still transfer calls from the Discord desktop or mobile app. For those who wish to join a DM or Group DM, the process is similar, but you will need to select "Direct Voice Chats" from the Discord menu in Game Base.

 A lot of games have built-in online voice chatting features, but if you were pivoting to using Discord for that purpose—whether it's because you want a private call or you simply prefer to use Discord over a game's voice chat—it's now an option that will work directly with your console without the need for workarounds. The option should be rolling out to you via a PS5 software update over the coming weeks.
