##  What to Look For in an HDMI 2.1 Cable in 2023

 An Ultra High-Speed HDMI cable (also known as an HDMI 2.1 or 48G HDMI cable) is essentially an HDMI cable that supports the features and specifications defined by HDMI Forum. It uses the same HDMI connectors as the older cables and is backward compatible. As long as the HDMI 2.1 cables support the necessary specifications, they are no different in features that they can offer.

 So, while shopping for an HDMI 2.1 cable, the most important thing to look for is the Ultra High-Speed HDMI certification, which confirms the cable meets the required specifications. That said, a non-certified cable from a reputed manufacturer can also meet the specifications and offer the same experience as a certified cable.

 Apart from the certification, you can look for specific cable attributes that make an HDMI cable more suitable for your setup than the other. For example, HDMI 2.1 cables with an angled connector or flat profile can be helpful in narrow spaces. Similarly, a braided cable is more durable than an HDMI cable with a regular TPU jacket. Plus, if you need a longer run of an HDMI 2.1 cable, it’s best to opt for an active, optical cable over a passive cable to avoid signal issues.

 Finally, you have to consider your budget. Just because one cable is more expensive than the other doesn’t make it better. Look for officially certified cables within your budget and go for them without worrying about incompatibility or problems.

| Pros                            | Cons        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Ultra High-Speed HDMI-certified | A bit stiff |
| Braiding for durability         |             |

 The [Zeskit Maya](https://www.amazon.com/48Gbps-Compatible-Netflix-Playstation-Samsung/dp/B07RZ8V78S/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the best HDMI 2.1 cable for most people. It comes in various sizes from [0.5 meters](https://www.amazon.com/48Gbps-Compatible-Netflix-Playstation-Samsung/dp/B08TRGKKR3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to [3 meters](https://www.amazon.com/48Gbps-Compatible-Netflix-Playstation-Samsung/dp/B07S196T4Z/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and has braiding for added durability. Plus, the cable is Ultra High-Speed HDMI-certified. So you know that you can enjoy everything from 4K games at 120Hz and VRR to Dynamic HDR and eARC without issues. As you can expect, it’s fully backward-compatible.

 In other highlights, the company has also priced the cable pretty reasonably. It’s not the cheapest cable on the market, but you are also not paying an exorbitant premium. Unfortunately, it's a bit stiff, given the braiding and solid copper conductors. But that’s a sacrifice you’ll have to make for quality and durability.

Cable Matters

| Pros                            | Cons        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Aggressive pricing              | No braiding |
| Multi-packs are cheaper         |             |
| Ultra High-Speed HDMI-certified |             |

 If you don’t want to pay a premium for an Ultra High-Speed HDMI cable, the [Cable Matters Ultra High-Speed HDMI Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Certified-Support-RTX3080/dp/B0BDSCP4QR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent option. It’s a no-frills but aggressively priced and officially certified HDMI 2.1 cable.

 It comes in three sizes—[one meter](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Certified-Support-RTX3080/dp/B0BDSCP4QR/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [two meters](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Certified-Support-RTX3080/dp/B0BDSJGLB1/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [three meters](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Certified-Support-RTX3080/dp/B0BDSCLF8R/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)—and you can pick from single or multipack options to save a bit more.

 Remember that Cable Matters has not included braiding to keep the pricing down. This won’t impact most people. But if your cable will be handled quite a bit, going from one connector to another and switching between machines frequently, it’s better to go for the [braided version from Cable Matters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CWGK7J8/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Nylon braiding for durability   | Stiff and bulky         |
| Ultra High-Speed HDMI-certified | No small length options |

 While all of our HDMI 2.1 cable recommendations are equally capable when it comes to gaming, the [UGREEN HDMI 2.1 Certified Cable](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Support-Dynamic-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B07Y825VFH/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is another excellent option you can consider. As the name suggests, it’s officially certified Ultra High Speed. The cable can support all next-generation gaming features, such as 4K 120Hz gaming, 4K 144Hz gaming, VRR, and ALLM. It’s also equally capable when it comes to home theater aspects.

 In addition, you get nylon braiding for enhanced durability and solid build quality. Unfortunately, the braiding does make it a bit bulky and stiff, but that’s to be expected.

 It’s also priced reasonably and available in larger lengths of [6.6 feet](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Support-Dynamic-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B07Y825VFH/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [10 feet](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Support-Dynamic-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B07ZZ2ZG2Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [16 feet](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Support-Dynamic-Compatible-Nintendo/dp/B09639XX4B/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Besides the angled connector, it has a braided jacket to reduce fraying and add extra strength. You also get support for all HDMI 2.1 specifications.

 If you don’t want unnecessary extra slack in your HDMI 2.1 cable, it’s best to get a short cable. Besides resulting in a neat setup, a shorter cable is also good for signal integrity as the signal has to travel a smaller distance. So there is little to no degradation. We recommend going with the [StarTech.com HDMI 2.1 Cable](https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-6ft-HDMI-2-1-Cable/dp/B0BFZ1NDQ6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for your short HDMI cable needs, as it’s available in lengths as small as [1.5 feet](https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-6ft-HDMI-2-1-Cable/dp/B0BFZ1NDQ6/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The cable is well-built and includes a flexible jacket to avoid putting unnecessary tension on the connectors. You will also be happy to know it is Ultra High-Speed HDMI certified.

 The only issue with the StarTech.com offering is its relatively premium pricing. If you don’t want to shell out over $20 for a 1.5 feet HDMI 2.1 cable, you can go with the [Zeskit Maya](https://www.amazon.com/48Gbps-Compatible-Netflix-Playstation-Samsung/dp/B08TRGKKR3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001201&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-hdmi-2-1-cables%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which also comes in 1.5 feet size and has braiding for extra durability.
