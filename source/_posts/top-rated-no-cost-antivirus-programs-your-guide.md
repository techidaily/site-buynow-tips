##  What to Look For in Antivirus Software

 There are dozens of antivirus software available on the market, each touting the same thing—broad protection of your devices from the latest ransomware and malware. But you will spend a lot each month or annually for that protection. If you want to save money, you need to look for free outliers that still offer a layer of protection, though it may not be quite as rigorous.

 When you’re looking for a new free antivirus software to download, there are key factors to pay attention to. If you download just any old software, you may find yourself ill-protected from more modern malware or even possibly opening the door to malicious digital entities without realizing it.

 The first thing you’ll want to check is whether the software is completely free or just a free trial that ends after a week or month. It can be easy to get lured in by “free” and completely overlook the stipulation that the software offers limited protection. This is just a matter of paying close attention to the fine details as you download the software. If you’re required to input a credit card number at any point, you know you’re signing up for a trial.

 Of course, the most important facet of any antivirus software is that it protects from malware, ransomware, and other nefarious agents. Even the best free antivirus software may have some gaps in protection, but you should pay attention to what each service offers. Along with virus protection, does it come with an enhanced firewall or a spam blocker? So long as the primary virus detection is effective, the more features, the better.

 You may also want to consider how notifications are delivered and whether the antivirus software works across various devices. The former will help reduce the headache of unnecessary and intrusive notifications, and the latter will help ensure even your smartphones and tablets can be protected.

 Choosing the software that will keep your computer and handheld devices safe is important in securing your personal data. To help you narrow down your options, we’ve selected five of the best free antivirus software available.

##  Best Free Antivirus Software for Windows: [Bitdefender](https://tools.techidaily.com/bitdefender/products/) 

![Bitdefender logo on grey background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bitdefender-logo.jpg) 

Bitdefender

| Pros                                         | Cons                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Very similar features to premium Bitdefender | Initial scan can take a long time         |
| Fast scanning after initial scan             | No protection against specific ransomware |
| Thorough malware protection                  | UI can be overwhelming at first           |

 While Bitdefender’s premium options are nothing to scoff at, its [free antivirus software for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/bitdefender/products/) keeps your devices safe. Unlike most free antivirus software, Bitdefender runs quietly in the background, never getting in the way of your daily processes. Despite its overall silent protection, it’s efficient in stopping ransomware attacks, cryptocurrency theft, modern “spearphishing,” and Trojans. When there is a threat, Bitdefender sends an unobtrusive push notification, allowing you to take action or ignore the potential threat.

 Bitdefender does offer a premium option, but you don’t lose much by sticking to the Windows-friendly free version. The free download includes all the core essentials as the premium, which keeps your PC safe from malware, malicious URLs, and phishing. The free version may only extend to three Windows devices, but more can be protected by creating another free account with a separate email address.

 Being free, there are some pitfalls. In the realm of antivirus software, though, they’re pretty manageable. When you run your first scan, don’t expect a quick turnaround. Bitdefender takes time to crawl your PC’s files to log every file, so it’s best to set it and forget it. You also won’t benefit from website ratings or vulnerability scans, but they’re worthy sacrifices for that zero-dollar price tag.

AVG

| Pros                         | Cons                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Advanced firewall protection | No 24/7 support for free version      |
| Phishing protection          | Slow full scan                        |
| Full of bonus features       | Not great at detecting malicious URLs |

 If it’s basic security you’re concerned about, [AVG Internet Security Antivirus](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU904565/https://www.avg.com/en-us/ppc/protection-offer-comparison-04) delivers with a free download. It may be missing some bells and whistles, such as spam and phishing email blockers, but it’s also not a $78 per year subscription. The trade-off is worth it, especially since you still benefit from spyware, ransomware, and virus protection; suspicious link and download protection; and real-time security updates.

 One of AVG’s best features is its interface. The simple desktop tool is easy to navigate, and running a scan is as simple as clicking a button. Don’t expect a scan to go fast, however. The initial scan will take some time, but even subsequent scans are slower. It could be a testament to AVG’s thoroughness, but after a few scans, you may get tired of how long it takes.

 AVG’s free antivirus software is surprising in how much it does and what it provides, including an enhanced firewall and behavior-based detection. The pros offset some cons, including not being able to fix performance issues without upgrading to the premium option and detecting the occasional false positive threat.

Best Feature-Rich Free Antivirus Software

#####  AVG Antivirus Free

_Malwarebytes_

  
| Pros                     | Cons                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Surprisingly fast scan   | Lacking real-time protection        |
| Thorough malware removal | Light on bonus features             |
| Includes Browser Guard   | Not as effective against ransomware |

 So long as you’re only looking for at-home protection, [Malwarebytes’ downloadable free antivirus software](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU904565/https://www.malwarebytes.com/) should work for you especially if you’re looking to protect your Mac or Android devices. You’ll find plenty of Windows-based free antivirus software, so Malwarebytes' broader scope is a nice change of pace. There is an iPhone app, but it’s only a spam call and ad blocker.

 The downside to Malwarebytes is that it doesn’t offer real-time protection. If you’re worried about malware and viruses, you’ll need to be proactive and run manual custom scans to hit every drive. However, the software excels in speed, completing scans faster than many free antivirus options. It doesn’t have the nicest interface, but it’s functional and easier to navigate after you spend a few minutes with it.

 Malwarebytes is a little limited in what it offers, but it’s a great base option for scanning a variety of different devices. Even for free software, it works well to deter phishing scams and block malicious URLs. A lack of a firewall may seem like a major setback, but Malwarebytes’ effective malware infestation control and removal makes up for many of its pitfalls.

| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Effective network inspections                 | Many features locked behind premium paywall |
| Phishing protection                           | Very slow boot-time scan                    |
| Won't interfere with other antivirus software | Internet privacy features could be better   |

 Despite having acquired AVG, Avast is still a separate software with its own benefits and features. The free software is a little light on functionality, especially compared to its $49.99 per year, 10-device premium option. However, if your main concern is viruses and malware, it’s still a viable option for your Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS devices.

 With [Avast’s free antivirus](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU904565/https://www.avast.com/en-us/lp-ppc-free-antivirus-brand-a1-buy), you’ll receive accurate real-time threat detection using an advanced AI. Users even benefit from one another. If Avast detects new suspicious behavior for one user, it will proactively push the cure out to other users. The proactive response keeps new malicious entities from spreading quickly and creates an enhanced security wall even for free accounts.

 Along with virus protection, Avast’s free program includes Wi-Fi security scans, which detect weaknesses and intruders, and measures that prevent ransomware agents from encrypting your files. There are some simple features available only to premium users that should be pushed to free accounts, including automatic app updates, an advanced firewall, and phishing prevention. Despite being a little bare-bones for bonus functions, the core antivirus software is powerful and very efficient at thwarting threats.

| Pros                               | Cons                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| VPN included in free version       | VPN hindered by limited bandwidth    |
| Automated virus definition updates | Too many features blocked by paywall |
| Highly customizable                | Fairly slow scan                     |

 Available for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS devices, Avira offers fairly extensive protection against several digital threats. ThoughEven its free version is designed to go after ransomware, adware, spyware, rootkits, trojans, worms, phishing, and hacking for a comprehensive kit to keep your devices secure.

 The AI-powered antivirus software maximizes device protection using cloud-based tech to prevent hogging system resources. Despite all that it scans for and prevents, Avira won’t cause system slowdown and will be relatively light on your CPU. You may run into performance issues with Phantom VPN, which struggles with high-bandwidth applications unless you subscribe to [Avira Prime](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lpxEf/pubref:UUhtgUeUpU904565/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avira.com%2Fen%2Fantivirus-pro).

[Avira’s free account](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lpxEf/pubref:UUhtgUeUpU904565/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avira.com%2Fen%2Ffree-antivirus) comes with several beneficial utilities, including System Speedup to clean your PC of old files, Browser Safety to protect against malicious websites, a convenient Password Manager, and Software Updater to keep up with driver and app updates. For all of its added features, though, Avira lacks a firewall, more advanced optimization, and a few other tools that simplify fixing performance issues.

 This free antivirus software goes above and beyond, even making it difficult to justify shelling out for the premium version.

### What is antivirus software?

 Antivirus software is a security program designed specifically to detect and remediate malicious viruses, malware, ransomware, and similar threats. The software scans your device’s files for known threats and removes them to prevent compromised data, performance loss, and identity theft.

### Do I need antivirus software for my Mac?

 Macs typically come with strong antivirus protections, but can still become infected. Antivirus software for your Mac is recommended to enhance your computer’s protection, especially from new viruses, ransomware, and malware threats.

### Do I need antivirus software if I use Linux?

 While Linux is less prone to viruses and comes with a high degree of protection, the OS can still become infected. Infections are rare, but if you’re running Linux, antivirus software is still recommended.
