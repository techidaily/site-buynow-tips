##  What to Look for in Headphones for Your Steam Deck

 The beauty of Valve's [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) and other [handheld PCs](https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-tech-devices-by-toms-authority-in-hardware/) is that it allows gamers to enjoy their favorite Steam titles on the go. But to get the very best out of your gameplay, you want to invest in a decent pair of headphones to maximize your gaming audio.

 Headsets and earbuds come in all shapes and sizes, with a range of features that are similarly diverse. Finding the right pair for you will come down to balancing those must-have features with a price point that suits you.

 Premium headsets such as the [Audeze Maxwell Wireless Gaming Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Maxwell-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0BNGT66Y5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001474&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-headphones-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and the [Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001474&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-headphones-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offer unbeatable sound quality and noise cancellation features, but they're not exactly cheap either.

 Consider the features that matter most. Some headsets are equipped with dedicated low-latency gaming modes, for seamless and synced audio, while others offer multipoint connection so that you can easily take calls or multitask mid-game. Battery life is an important consideration too, as is the ability to customize your audio to suit the type of games that you love to play.

 You'll want to select something that provides lasting comfort, as you won't want a headset that causes pinching or overheating while in use. And for the initial outlay, you should look at headphones that are durable enough to last some time. After all, most gaming peripherals cost a pretty penny, and you won't want to fork out for a replacement pair any time soon.

 We've sifted through some of the best headphones and headsets for the Steam Deck to pick out a selection that's suitable for all budgets and requirements.

 The [Razer Barracuda X Wireless Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Barracuda-Wireless-Headset-Playstation/dp/B09XZXRFPX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001474&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-headphones-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) makes a great overall choice for your Steam Deck. This mid-range gaming headset features Razer's Smartswitch dual wireless, giving you the choice of Hyperspeed wireless or Bluetooth 5.2 connections that you can toggle between for optimized low-latency performance.

 Triforce 40-millimeter drivers provide a solid and satisfying sound performance across the high and mid-ranges and some meaty, bassy lows for an immersive experience. There is also cardioid mic that can be fine-tuned to suppress background noise and provide enhanced voice capture while gaming. Don't need to talk? The microphone is detachable, so you can get it out of your way whenever you're not using it.

 Flowknit memory foam ear cushions and a thick headband cushion provide plenty of comfort for extended gameplay sessions, and an impressive 50-hour battery life keeps you in the thick of the action for longer—far beyond what one Steam Deck charge can get you, so you don't need to worry about the Barracuda dying mid-session.

 You can customize your experience with this headset using a plethora of options on the [Razer Audio app](https://mysupport.razer.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/3877/~/razer-audio-app-support-%26-faqs), with a fully customizable EQ, Do Not Disturb settings, Game Modes, and more. Simple, intuitive controls on the headset itself allow you to easily toggle the Smartswitch, mute your mic, manage audio playback, or adjust the volume.

 With a Type-C dongle included in the package for multi-platform support as well, this is a seriously good gaming headset for less than $100, and the best overall choice for your Steam Deck.

| Pros                                      | Cons         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Discord-certified                         | Not wireless |
| Plenty of customization options with iCue |              |
| Supports Dolby Surround on PC or Mac      |              |

 If you're shopping for a decent headset for your Steam Deck but have a modest budget to play with, we recommend the [Corsair HS65 Surround Gaming Headset](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Leatherette-SonarWorks-Multi-Platform-Compatibility/dp/B09YHQ3Y61?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001474&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-headphones-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). With support for Dolby Audio 7.1 Surround Sound on PC and Mac (using [Corsair's iCue](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/s/downloads) software) and multi-platform support, there's plenty to admire here for the price point.

 Armed with custom-tuned 50-millimeter drivers, the audio output is surprisingly hefty, given the budget price tag. The soundscape can be tweaked even further using the iCue software, which comes with a neat SoundID feature built-in. This allows you to customize your sound profile based on your personal preferences, applying the results of a simple and intuitive sound test.

 Its memory foam earpads are wrapped in breathable microfiber and leatherette to provide lasting comfort, and its lightweight design won't weigh heavy on your head, even after several hours in a chair.

 This gaming headset is Discord-certified and features an omnidirectional mic that provides crystal-clear voice capture for staying in touch with your squad, and a flip-to-mute function if you prefer not to be heard. On-ear controls allow you to quickly adjust the volume as you play, too, so there's no need to pause the action.

 On the downside, this gaming headset works via a USB connection or 3.5mm jack, so there's no Bluetooth here. It's never ideal to be wired to your handheld while playing, but for its sound quality, customizable settings, and durability, the HS65 is still well worth considering.

 For less than $50, you're probably going to struggle to find a decent Bluetooth headset for your Steam Deck. However, the [Razer Hammerhead True Wireless Gaming Earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Hammerhead-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds/dp/B07Z77V1RH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001474&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-headphones-for-steam-deck%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) make an excellent alternative. Pocket-sized and portable, these Bluetooth earbuds are just the ticket for your morning commute.

 Aimed specifically at gamers, these earbuds feature a dedicated 60ms low-latency gaming mode, for an immersive audio experience. Your audio stays synced and there's no stutter either, so you won't suffer any disruption to the overall gaming performance.

 Bluetooth 5.0 with auto-pairing automatically connects to the last paired device, right out of the charging case, so they're fast and fuss-free to use. Plus, voice assistant compatibility and touch-enabled controls make them even more convenient and versatile to use.

 You can squeeze 15 hours of battery life out of these wireless earbuds on a full charge (when used with the charging case), and an IPX4 water resistance rating means they'll comfortably withstand any potential splash damage as you move through your day.

 With custom-tuned 13-millimeter dynamic drivers delivering high-quality audio, the Razer Hammerhead Wireless Earbuds are one of the best ways to enjoy Steam Deck gameplay on the move.
