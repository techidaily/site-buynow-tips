##  What to Look For in a Screen Protector in 2023

 No matter how careful you are, the screen is the most vulnerable part of your iPhone 14\. Even if you never drop your phone, simply using it often enough is all it takes to degrade the quality of your screen.

 Any screen protector you choose takes the damage your screen would have otherwise. Tempered glass is the strongest, but it's not the only option. Film screen protectors (often PET plastic) are cheaper and easier to apply, and some people prefer the feel.

 In addition to protecting your screen from physical damage, a screen protector protects the [oleophobic coating](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fixing-foneazy-mockgo-not-working-on-honor-x9b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) on your iPhone. This helps keep your screen fingerprint-free, but can wear down over time from use. A screen protector preserves this, and tempered glass screen protectors typically have an oleophobic coating of their own.

 A screen protector can also be useful from a privacy standpoint. While most screen protectors are just that, some use a polarized feature to keep nearby strangers from seeing what's on your screen. If you frequently deal with sensitive data on your phone, this is an essential feature.

 Your screen isn't the only part of your phone made from glass. Your camera lenses are equally important and equally vulnerable. Fortunately, tempered glass screen protectors for the iPhone 14 camera lens are also available, and they're occasionally included with screen protectors.

 Of course, to protect your iPhone 14 as much as possible, you should also use a case. While cases [may not be as effective](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) as we'd like, they still offer more protection than not using one at all.

 Spigen has been a major player in iPhone cases for years, so it only makes sense that the company would make screen protectors as well. The [Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-AGL03385/dp/B095RTJH1M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) offers maximum protection for your screen, and it's easy to use.

 When measuring how tough a tempered glass screen protector is, manufacturers use a [hardness scale](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximizing-video-impact-zooming-strategies-for-snapchat/) that ranges from 6 to 9\. Higher numbers are better, and the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector is rated at 9H hardness, which is as good as it gets.

 In general, a screen protector shouldn't make the iPhone's screen look worse. Using tempered glass instead of film can help, but so does an oleophobic coating. Like your iPhone's screen, this screen protector features an oleophobic coating.

 Even if you have incredibly steady hands, precisely aligning a screen protector is all but impossible without help. That's why Spigen has included an auto-alignment installation kit to ensure you properly place the screen protector on your phone on the first try. Just make sure your phone is completely clean, or else specks of dust might get trapped underneath.

 It's important to remember that screen protectors are like bicycle helmets---they're meant to take damage instead of what they're protecting, which means you need to replace them. In the case of the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector, not only is it affordable but comes as a two-pack to make sure you have a replacement on hand.

 The Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector is available for [iPhone 14](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-AGL03385/dp/B095RTJH1M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [iPhone 14 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-Designed-Friendly/dp/B095RQQTRF?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [iPhone 14 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-designed-Friendly/dp/B0B244R4KB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [iPhone 14 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Tempered-Protector-designed-Friendly/dp/B0B23LW7NV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 Screen protectors aren't particularly expensive in the first place, but they can vary in price, and an iPhone 14 is an expensive purchase. If you're looking for maximum protection for a minimum spend, look no further than the [Supershieldz Glass Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Installation/dp/B09J5B2VWW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 Just like our [overall pick](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/top-10-affordable-360-degree-cameras-for-2024/), the Supershieldz Tempered Glass Screen Protector features a [9H hardness rating](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximizing-video-impact-zooming-strategies-for-snapchat/). Not only does this protect your screen, but also features more scratch resistance than screen protectors with lower hardness ratings.

 Supershieldz calls its glass "2.5D rounded edge glass," which features smooth edges for a better feel. Similarly to our overall pick, this screen protector features a hydrophobic, oleophobic coating to resist picking up fingerprints during daily use.

 While it varies from the method Spigen uses, the Supershieldz screen protector features an auto-alignment tray. This makes placing the screen protector on your phone a much easier experience than trying to line it up manually.

 Like all screen protectors, you'll eventually need to replace your Supershieldz. Fortunately, the company includes a second screen protector in the box.

 The Supershieldz Tempered Glass Screen Protector is available for [iPhone 14](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Installation/dp/B09J5B2VWW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [iPhone 14 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Installation/dp/B09J59Z9WB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [iPhone 14 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Installation/dp/B0BFJMDQ8R?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [iPhone 14 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-Tempered-Protector-Installation/dp/B0BFJNHZQ9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 While a tempered glass is the material of choice for most screen protectors, they're not for everyone. Some people prefer the feel and touch sensitivity of a film screen protector like the [Supershieldz PET 14 Screen Protector](https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Designed-iPhone-Protector-Definition/dp/B09D9ZRTWR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 Supershieldz uses high-quality Japanese PET film, which consists of five layers of protection. This material is easier to install than tempered glass, but earlier film screens would leave residue on your phone's screen. PET screen protectors have come a long way, and Supershieldz says these are residue-free.

 The biggest advantage of film screen protectors is the feel and touch sensitivity. To help the overall feel, the top layer of this film screen protector uses HD Clear Coating. This helps your screen stay looking shiny and new, but also feels more seamless to use.

 Supershieldz doesn't include an alignment tool for installing these screen protectors. As mentioned above, toolless installation is easier with film screens, but this is something you should note if you're buying this brand of film protectors.

 One of the major downsides of film screen protectors is that they're more easily damaged and must be replaced more often. The good news is that Supershieldz includes six film screen protectors in this pack, so you'll have replacements ready for some time.

 There are many professions where privacy is paramount, and some people just don't want strangers peeking at their phones in public. If that's you, try the [Ailun 2Pack Privacy Screen Protector for iPhone 14](https://www.amazon.com/Ailun-Protector-Tempered-Friendly-Hardness/dp/B0B76D4TGC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 A privacy screen protector doesn't mean there is no possibility of a nearby stranger seeing what is on your screen, but it reduces it. These screen protectors reduce the angle at which your screen is visible, meaning you need to be more or less directly in front of the screen to see it.

 This does have downsides. While the filter in the screen helps protect your information, it reduces the overall brightness of your screen. You can turn up the brightness to counteract this, but this slightly reduces the effectiveness of the filter, and it can reduce overall battery life.

 The Ailun Privacy Screen Protector is made of tempered glass with 9H hardness, so it will protect your phone as well as any other screen protector we're looking at. Even better, it includes a camera lens protector to keep the other important pieces of glass on your phone safe.

 Like all screen protectors, you'll eventually need to replace this one. Ailun includes a pair of screen and camera lens protectors in the box.

 Depending on how often you use your iPhone 14 camera, the lens glass may be more important to you than the phone's screen. To keep your camera safe, turn to the [Ailun 3 Pack Camera Lens Protector for iPhone 14](https://www.amazon.com/Ailun-Protector-14-Plus-Anti-Scratch/dp/B0B766Y9P3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 Like the screen protectors we're looking at, the Ailun Camera Lens Protector is made from tempered glass with 9H hardness. Adding glass on top of your lens can potentially affect your photos, but AIlun says on the Amazon listing that this won't get in the way of your photos, even night shots.

 In another aspect similar to most of the screen protectors we've looked at, this camera lens protector features an oleophobic coating. This is essential, as a big thumbprint over your camera lens could ruin your carefully planned perfect shot.

 Because of the shape, lining up a camera lens protector is easier than positioning a screen protector. This is good because Ailun doesn't include an installation kit. That said, the company has a video on the store page showing you how to install the lens protector precisely.

 Camera lens protectors generally don't see the heavy use that screen protectors do, so they typically last longer. Still, Ailun includes three lens protectors in the box, so you'll have replacements ready.

 The Ailun Camera Lens Protector is available for [iPhone 14 / 14 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Ailun-Protector-14-Plus-Anti-Scratch/dp/B0B766Y9P3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [iPhone 14 Pro / 14 Pro Max](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B768XC42?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU204014&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840344%2Fbest-iphone-14-screen-protectors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).
