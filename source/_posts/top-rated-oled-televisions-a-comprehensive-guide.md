##  What to Look for in an OLED TV in 2023

[OLED](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) TVs have grown in popularity over the last decade. They are different from LED-backlit LCD TVs (LED TVs), employing self-emissive pixels instead of a backlight. As a result, they can turn on and off individual pixels, resulting in inky blacks and an unmatched [contrast ratio](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-laugh-ledger-unveiling-the-best-text-generation-apps/).

 Six major TV manufacturers are offering OLED TVs in the US—LG, Panasonic, Samsung, Skyworth, Sony, and Vizio—with each using either a W-OLED panel from [LG Display](https://www.lgdisplay.com/eng) or a [QD-OLED panel](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solved-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-keeps-crashing/) from [Samsung Display](https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/index.jsp).

 But despite having OLED panels from just two manufacturers, the individual televisions can be quite different. So when you are in the market for a new OLED TV, it's a good idea to keep an eye on a few things.

 Traditional OLED panels don't get very bright, so they are not ideal for a room with a ton of ambient light. However, some premium OLED TVs use newer [OLED evo](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-correctly-address-and-repair-a-missing-mscorwksdll-error/) or QD-OLED panels that can get over 20% brighter than conventional OLED panels.

 Apart from an improved OLED panel, manufacturers like Sony also use an enhanced heatsink in some OLED TVs to push the brightness levels even higher. So if you want a brighter OLED TV, picking one with an OLED evo or QD-OLED panel is your best bet.

 Additionally, if you are going to play games on your new OLED TV, you should look for next-generation gaming features like [variable refresh rate (VRR)](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), [auto low latency mode (ALLM)](https://win11.techidaily.com/turn-the-tide-solving-chrome-file-upload-issues-on-windows-pcs/), and [HDMI 2.1](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-screen-mirroring-you-must-know-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) ports. These features will allow you to fully use the features present in Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Sony PlayStation 5, and PCs with high-end graphics cards. Similarly, movie buffs would appreciate the presence of advanced HDR formats, like [Dolby Vision](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/best-drone-buddies-kids-most-enjoyed-toy-companions-for-2024/) and [HDR10+](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-pathway-to-prosperity-a-graphic-designers-journey/), and features like the [Filmmaker Mode](https://article-files.techidaily.com/inverting-image-hues-in-photoshop/).

| Pros                                      | Cons                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Stunning picture quality                  | Costly                              |
| MLA tech enables high-peak brightness     | 83-inch model doesn't have MLA tech |
| ATSC 3.0 support                          | No stand in the box                 |
| 120Hz panel, VRR, and four HDMI 2.1 ports |                                     |

 OLED TVs are known for their impressive picture quality and wide viewing angles. But LG's latest 4K flagship, the [G3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVX2RLV2/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), takes things one step further by including a [Micro Lens Array](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). This results in significantly brighter images, which were impossible to imagine on OLED TVs until just a few years ago. So you can enjoy stunning visuals in every lighting condition, and the TV's HDR performance leaves little to be desired.

 The G3 is also great at [upscaling](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/your-roadmap-to-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-google-podcasting/), so even the low-resolution content looks good on the TV's 4K screen. And thanks to [ATSC 3.0](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/ai-writing-unmasked-5-must-have-detectors-for-academic-and-corporate-leaders/) support, the TV can access high-resolution broadcast signals.

 In terms of ports, LG has packed four HDMI 2.1 ports, all of which are full-bandwidth. One of these ports also acts as the [eARC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-snapchat-checklist-for-engaging-content-for-2024/) port. And the TV can pass through DTS as well as Dolby audio tracks to your connected soundbar or AV receiver without trouble. Gaming is also a strong point of the G3, as it supports VRR and has a 120Hz panel with low input lag.

 While the TV has no real weaknesses, some people will miss the lack of a tabletop stand as the company doesn't include one and hopes you'll hang the TV on a wall. There is a slim wall mount included, though. Also, the TV is pretty expensive, and its [83-inch model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVXCLQCJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn't have MLA technology, so it's not as bright as the rest of the sizes. If you want the brightest OLED in a large size, it's best to stick with the [77-inch model](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVWYRK3G/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

Best OLED TV Overall

#####  LG G3

The LG G3 destroys the OLED brightness barriers with MLA technology and delivers a bright and beautiful picture. It's also an excellent gaming TV and packs four HDMI 2.1 ports.

| Pros                           | Cons                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Excellent picture quality      | No advanced gaming features |
| Dolby Vision and Atmos support | No HDMI 2.1 ports           |
| Good upscaling                 |                             |

 None of the OLED TVs on the market are exactly budget models, but the [LG A2](https://www.amazon.com/LG-55-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED55A2PUA/dp/B09RMMHCSH/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is among the most affordable and delivers great performance. Like every other OLED TV, it can produce inky blacks and has a near-infinite contrast ratio to get fantastic picture quality. And thanks to its decent peak brightness, the HDR performance is also respectable. Plus, the TV comes with [HDR10](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instant-upload-tiktok-vids-to-your-fb-page-easily/) and Dolby Vision support.

 The TV's design is fairly utilitarian but clean, with easy access to most ports, even when you hang it on a wall. Its build quality is also good, so even though it's an entry-level model in LG's lineup, it doesn't feel cheap or substandard. webOS is responsible for the software in the A2, and it's easy to use with a well-stocked app library. You will also get access to [Google Assistant](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-21-edition-exploration-mastering-vegas-pro-for-gambling/) and [Amazon Alexa](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-illusions-realized-what-is-augmented-reality-for-2024/) voice assistants.

 In other features, the A2 has no trouble upscaling lower-resolution content, including 480p sources. It also removes [judder](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/fixing-video-editing-software-failures-after-effects-stability-on-windows-11-and-10/) from most sources, except for those that [only output at 60Hz](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/a2-oled). However, one of the areas where the A2 falls short is the advanced gaming features. It has a 60Hz display, no VRR support, or HDMI 2.1 ports. However, you still get the auto-low latency mode and a low input lag for responsive gaming.

 You can buy the A2 in [48-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-48-class-a2-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6501902.p), [55-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-55-class-a2-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6501901.p%3FskuId%3D6501901), [65-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-a2-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6501900.p%3FskuId%3D6501900), and [77-inch](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-77-class-a2-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6501899.p) models.

LG

| Pros                       | Cons                               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 4K 120fps gaming support   | No HDR10+ support                  |
| Four HDMI 2.1 ports        | Doesn't get as bright as the LG G3 |
| Low input lag              |                                    |
| Impressive picture quality |                                    |

 LG's high-end OLED TVs have traditionally been great for gaming, and its [C3](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED65C3PUA/dp/B0BVXF72HV/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is no exception. Like the [G3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVX2RLV2/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), our best OLED TV overall pick and a fantastic TV for gaming, it houses all the features you need to get the most out of modern gaming consoles and PCs.

 It has a 120Hz panel and support for AMD, HDMI Forum, and NVIDIA's variable refresh rate technologies. So there is barely any screen tearing, and the games look excellent. Moreover, the TV's OLED evo screen ensures you get stunning visuals, whether it's a cutscene or actual gameplay. Gaming also feels responsive thanks to the C3's low input lag. Plus, there is Dolby Vision and HDR10 support to enjoy HDR games, movies, and TV shows in their full glory.

 Even beyond gaming, the LG C3 is a great television and an excellent alternative to the G3 if you don't have the budget for the flagship. The only area you'll be sacrificing is the peak brightness. The C3 doesn't get as bright as the G3\. Finally, you can buy the C3 in various sizes, from [42 inches](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED65C3PUA/dp/B0BVXK9N6X/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) to [83 inches](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED65C3PUA/dp/B0BVX7D41W/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). The 42-inch model will particularly come in handy for anyone planning to connect it to their gaming PC permanently.

[Sony's A95K](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R95YP36/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a TV that employs the QD-OLED panel. As a result, you get the same vibrant and punchy colors. But the main benefit of going for the Sony TV is its picture processing, which makes it the absolute best television for movies. It upscales lower-resolution content without any artifacts and has [impressive motion handling](https://www.expertreviews.co.uk/sony/1417193/sony-a95k-review). So you won't encounter any judder regardless of the source.

 The Sony TV also benefits from the relatively high brightness of the QD-OLED panel, retaining the highlights and delivering solid HDR performance. You also get Dolby Vision support, but the less common HDR10+ format is missing.

 The A95K also has a striking design that will make heads turn. Its unique stand enables the display to sit flush against the table. But if you prefer to put the soundbar in front of the TV, it will block a part of the screen. Even beyond movie watching, this Sony television is fantastic. It has all the advanced gaming features and comes with the Google TV platform with a solid app library.

 Sadly, you can only buy it in [55-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R95YP36/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [65-inch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R94DJ72/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models. If you want a bigger size, you'll have to settle for [Sony's A80K](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09R95CGSW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which uses a W-OLED panel but has the same impressive picture processing and motion handling.

| Pros                                              | Cons                         |

 There is a lot to like about the [LG G3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVWZJ2YV/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which is why, apart from being our best OLED TV overall pick, it's also our recommendation for the best 65-inch OLED TV. Whether you like to watch movies, TV shows, sports, or play games, the LG G3 produces spectacular pictures with colors that look lifelike and vibrant. Thanks to MLA technology, it gets brighter than all of LG's previous OLED models and can take on most LED TVs in this department. As a result, you don't have to worry about having a dark room to enjoy it fully.

 It also delivers a punchy HDR performance and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10\. Other features include four HDMI 2.1 ports, a 120Hz panel, advanced gaming features, low input lag, wide viewing angles, and excellent reflection handling.

 Another highlight of the LG TV is its design. It looks fantastic thanks to its slim bezels and a design that sits flush with the wall when hung.

 LG is using webOS as the smart TV platform. It's relatively easy to use and has a solid app collection that includes all popular streaming services.

 But as you can expect, being LG's flagship 4K TV, it's expensive. Your TV setup will become even more costly if you plan to place it on a table, as the company doesn't ship a stand in the box. Apart from the [LG A2](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-a2-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6501900.p) that we have already mentioned as our budget pick, value-conscious buyers can consider the 65-inch models of [LG C3](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED65C3PUA/dp/B0BVXDPZP3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [LG B3](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Class-OLED65B3PUA-Built/dp/B0BVXMG2WH/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), or 2022's [LG C2](https://www.amazon.com/LG-65-Inch-Refresh-AI-Powered-OLED65C2PUA/dp/B09RMRNSBF/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207081&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F782912%2Fbest-oled-tv%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

## FAQ

### What does OLED mean?

 An[organic light-emitting diode or OLED](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) is a type of display panel used in televisions. Each pixel in an OLED panel is made of an organic compound that emits light when jolted with electricity. As a result, OLED displays don't require a backlight and can self-illuminate.

### How do I clean an OLED TV screen?

 You can[clean an OLED TV screen](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-top-10-capture-cards-for-youtube-you-should-know/) with a dry microfiber cloth. But if you encounter a tough stain, spray distilled water on the cloth to help. Don't spray water directly on the screen or use alcohol-based cleaning agents. You should also avoid using paper towels or other abrasive materials to clean the screen.

### Can you lay your OLED TV flat?

 While you can lay your OLED TV flat when it's out of the packaging and you want to install the stand, it's not recommended to[lay it flat when transporting](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F3607085%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUhtgUeUpU207081%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fau%2Fsupport%2Fproduct-help%2FCT20088015-20150351567855), as the packaging may or may not have adequate support in that position.

### Can you wall-mount an OLED TV?

 OLED TVs, like LCD televisions, can be mounted on a wall. First, you will require a proper mounting bracket, which you can fix directly on the studs or in a masonry wall. Then, you can install the mounting plate on the back of the OLED television and hang it on the bracket.

### What's the difference between an OLED and QLED TV?

[OLED](https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-combine-videos-without-restrictions-7-best-watermark-free-tools/) and[QLED TVs](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-perfect-pairing-of-podcast-apps-and-android-top-6-recommendations/) are pretty different as they use different display panels. An OLED panel is self-emissive and doesn't require a backlight, whereas QLED TVs, which are LCD TVs with quantum dot technology, use LED backlighting to display images on the screen.
