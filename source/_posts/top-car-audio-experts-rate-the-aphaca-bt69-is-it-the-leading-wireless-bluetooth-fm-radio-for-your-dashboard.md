 Pros

 Cons

* Laptop compatibility limited to models with USB-C

 The PowerCore+ 26,800mAh power bank includes a wall charger and a USB-C charging cable. It has two standard 15W USB ports and a 45W USB-C port. This faster connection and the included USB-C wall charger make this bundle a fantastic option for USB-C-compatible laptops.

 The Anker PowerCore+ power bank is TSA-approved and weighs about 1.5 pounds. Unlike many other laptop batteries, it’s surprisingly compact at 7.7 x 3.5 x 2.4 inches, making it an easy addition to your carry-on or commuter bag. And it holds a lot of power for its size.

 The PowerCore+ can charge a smartphone up to six times or completely recharge a 13-inch MacBook Pro. That’s hours and hours of extra time on your devices without finding a wall outlet.

 Our tester also liked that it measures 8.1 x 5.3 x 1.3 inches and weighs 2.77 pounds, so it could easily fit into your camping bag and won’t be that much heavier. Finally, it includes 14 types of laptop connectors, so it covers most models but not those powered via[USB-C](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490) .

 Check if your laptop is supported before purchasing.

### Capacity

 When picking a portable laptop battery charger, one of your primary considerations should be its capacity to store energy (measured in mAh)—this denotes the device’s battery life before it needs to be recharged. Be sure that the battery has equal or more capacity than the one already inside your machine so that you can expect a full charge.

### Output

 Some portable chargers can be a bit slow when outputting a charge, so be sure that the battery you’re purchasing has an output equal to or higher than the wattage of your typical laptop charger.

### Connectors

 It’s critical to ensure you can plug your laptop into your new portable charger. Check the type of inputs the charger supports—whether that’s a standard wall outlet plug, a USB-C port, or other universal solutions.

 FAQ

* What's the largest battery you can travel with if you're flying?  
[According to the TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-more-100-watt-hours) , this depends on the battery's watt-hours (Wh). Laptop batteries are only allowed in carry-on luggage and cannot be inside checked bags. Passengers can carry up to two spare batteries, but they can't exceed 160 watt-hours each. All laptop batteries must list their capacity on the product, typically in milliamp-hours (mAh). That equates to about a single 81K mAh battery or two 43K mAh batteries.
* How can you extend the life of your laptop battery?  
 There are several ways to improve the lifespan of your laptop battery. Firstly, keep your laptop cool by shutting it down when not in use and never storing it in a hot place. If your battery is fully charged, never leave it plugged in. And finally, you should fully discharge the battery once a month to help your battery life estimate stay accurate.
* How does a laptop battery explode?  
 Fail-safes are in place to prevent "thermal runaway," which refers to a battery generating more heat than it can handle. This process usually results from faulty manufacturing or product tampering but can also result from overcharging or storing it in scorching areas. However, batteries will rarely combust under these conditions, but they can rupture. Regardless, if it begins to swell, dispose of it immediately (and safely) and replace it.
