 When it comes to ebooks, there aren't many names that can compete with the mighty Kindle. It's become synonymous with eReaders, almost like what Kleenex is to tissues. One of the few competitors worth knowing about is Barnes & Noble's Nook series, but can it really stand up to the behemoth that is Amazon?

##  Kindle Is King of ebooks

![Kindle eReader showing the Kindle book store.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/52781459029_62883c06f3_o.jpg)

 Kindle is far and away the most well-known name in the eReader world. ebooks have been outselling physical books on Amazon since 2010, and its library has continued to grow. When it comes to sheer number of titles and the ease of purchasing, it's hard to beat Amazon and Kindle.

 As of March 2023, it was estimated that there are over 12 million ebooks available in the Amazon Kindle Store. Barnes & Noble claims the title of "world's largest bookstore," but when it comes to _digital goods_, there are only around 4 million titles available in the Nook Books store. Kindle is the clear winner in sheer volume, though bestsellers and popular authors are available on both platforms.

##  Nook Is Less Intrusive

 One of the biggest knocks on Kinde eReaders is their pure, unadulterated _Amazon-ness_. A Kindle may not be as blatantly stuffed with [Amazon services](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/deactivating-your-androids-facebook-feature-easy-instructions-inside/) as a [Fire Tablet](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-screenshot-tasks-in-minutes-for-2024/), but there's no mistaking who owns it. Clearly, if you're not a fan of Amazon, a Kindle is not for you.

 The Kindle ecosystem is loaded with ads, even if you pay extra for an ad-free Kindle. There are book recommendations (a fancy word for "ads") everywhere you turn, not to mention plugs for the [Kindle Unlimited subscription service](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/msi-unveils-top-tier-z890-and-b8n60-boards-for-intel-arc-s-certified-before-the-excitement-of-computex-2024-begins/). Kindle eReaders will also try to get you to use [Goodreads](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-vivo-s18-by-drfone-android/), which is owned by Amazon, too.

 All that being said, I have to admit I am not a fan of Amazon, but I still opted for a Kindle eReader. You may feel the same way after reading more about the trade-offs of using a Nook.

##  Kindle eReaders Have Nicer Hardware

 Maybe you don't care about ecosystems as much, and you just want the best hardware. Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble offer a few different models, though Amazon tends to refresh its lineup more often. At the time of writing in March 2024, there are six current-generation Kindles and four current-generation Nooks.

 Looking at the company's baseline models, the [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-16-GB-adjustable/dp/B09TMZKQR7/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.T8SZvU7f-5wX6LcRTZ1Mz1KpmBRJdJ91wLG4xi9KSxv%5F4w2tfEK1rCkEZ9BVVNLKjXuY366uxzcNokrL8yGEbgiYqMuTqY67CmgPcy9rO6R8f7lmB2qoNnU-12cxIfyxy5RppNUZszeUprjGZBermnSKi2bDxoDK0DA2mAsiqNaSwFfEGmOzLGi8x08QZnkzTrbctlcZf1JY2FIuer7RJOAB44Hx8xWsGo-zGKvWPKk.PokdozhT6vV7IszkNr9y0OHdDF%5F9tTUmBBGgupE0qTw&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=Kindle+paperwhite&qid=1711549868&sr=8-1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002465&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkindle-vs-nook-which-e-reader-is-best-for-you%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) and [Nook GlowLight 4](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002465/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-barnes-noble/1140326110), there are several key hardware advantages in the Kindle's favor.

 First, the Paperwhite has a 6.8-inch flush display, while the GlowLight has a smaller 6-inch display that's inset from the bezels. The flush display may not make a huge usability difference, but it feels less cheap than an inset display. The Kindle display is also brighter, and the touchscreen is more responsive.

 The Paperwhite's battery is [considerably better](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/kindle-paperwhite-vs-nook-glowlight-4#battery-life), only draining 12% in a week compared to 55% on the GlowLight. It's also heavier than the GlowLight, which may not be the best for long reading sessions, but it does make the Paperwhite feel more durable. Speaking of durability, the Paperwhite has an IPX8 rating, while the GlowLight has none.

 Amazon has been making eReaders longer than Barnes & Nobile, and it's put out many more models over the years. That experience shows in the hardware. Even when comparing models in the same price bracket, the Kindle often feels like a more premium product.

##  Nook eReaders Still Have Page Turn Buttons

![Nook eReader with a book open.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nook-5.jpg)

 Now, if you're looking for a very specific hardware feature, there is one area where the Nook comes out on top: page turn buttons. As of March 2024, all of Nook's eReaders still include physical page turn buttons. The most recent Kindle to still have page turn buttons is the [Kindle Oasis](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Refurbished-Kindle-Oasis-Ad-Supported/dp/B07L93JZ2N/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=447ZTQGHO0GQ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NYz0UaO8Z2cg0cbLEQaI2mLady5JMBeF0SaCYgQ1J4s8%5FZW7bsmLsVssamGhAsg7yTDoYvZ01iN5joKKVIGsRZvuQ4PPNk-1h1hpR4CsnHTtsuZCUxOQmcxIceuZocYHUxxkOueU%5Fwdv8boWEFTJV1zt69oFJaqTs3RJVN9YlL2tvl5M8w2Y1rnXl25Y4Np6X1AeXTMsHnUhNpUIftDg64kE%5FyTXTlOaIpXq%5FO1amIo.1pVWpD4ud9-8BO2qU6sxGuFGTOlOJOW8pvJwkfWRxMQ&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=Kindle+oasis&qid=1711550266&sprefix=kindle+oasis%2Caps%2C145&sr=8-1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002465&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkindle-vs-nook-which-e-reader-is-best-for-you%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) from 2019.

 Nooks not only use these buttons for page-turning but they can also be used to jump chapters. Some say the buttons are not as responsive as the touchscreen. However, a physical button can't be replicated, and some people just find it more comfortable. If that's a big deal for you, the Nook is your choice.

##  Kindle Is Better for Library Cards

 One big reason why I personally chose a Kindle despite my feelings about Amazon is library books. Technically, both Kindle and Nook eReaders can read library books from the Libby app. However, it is far, far easier to do with a Kindle.

[Kindles integrate with Libby very well](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/). You simply link your accounts and device, and when you check out an eBook in the Libby app, it is automatically sent to your Kindle. Easy peasy.

 To get books from Libby onto a Nook, you'll need to get your computer involved. You have to download the EPUB or PDF from the Libby website, open the file in Adobe Digital Editions, and then manually transfer it to the Nook that's connected to your computer. It's certainly doable but far more involved than the Kindle.

##  Nook eReaders Are Cheaper, But Barely

![Nook eReader format options.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nook-1.jpg) 

Corbin Davenport / How-To Geek

 Let's talk about pricing. Across, the board, Nook eReaders are a bit cheaper than Kindles, but it's very close. The [Kindle Paperwhite 11th Generation is $159.99](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-16-GB-adjustable/dp/B09TMZKQR7/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.T8SZvU7f-5wX6LcRTZ1Mz1KpmBRJdJ91wLG4xi9KSxv%5F4w2tfEK1rCkEZ9BVVNLKjXuY366uxzcNokrL8yGEbgiYqMuTqY67CmgPcy9rO6R8f7lmB2qoNnU-12cxIfyxy5RppNUZszeUprjGZBermnSKi2bDxoDK0DA2mAsiqNaSwFfEGmOzLGi8x08QZnkzTrbctlcZf1JY2FIuer7RJOAB44Hx8xWsGo-zGKvWPKk.PokdozhT6vV7IszkNr9y0OHdDF%5F9tTUmBBGgupE0qTw&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=Kindle+paperwhite&qid=1711550342&sr=8-1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002465&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkindle-vs-nook-which-e-reader-is-best-for-you%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) without lock screen ads, while the [Nook GlowLight 4 is $149.99](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002465/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-barnes-noble/1140326110). However, if you don't mind the ads, you can get the Paperwhite for $139.99.

 Barnes & Noble's "budget" option, the [Nook GlowLight 4e is $99.99](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002465/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4e-barnes-noble/1140326109?ean=9780594149279), while the [standard Kindle is $119.99](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-the-lightest-and-most-compact-kindle/dp/B09SWV3BYH/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=1VLFIH3AP3G7Q&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HGf6D6jldta6sEQ0RIMM7BfYxG3jiOUTZ9jmHVff88fYk4gqtuapNHKi8A98uRhjw2ojcCGu6Eiv48AKKJBauqmLQDwkasFRdjr2dJ5LDvg3IU1alHGBPlIAnyM81l8gSOuD5uEhr46g7pkKfsuMrsYUP3yJ5TKDJmvbleO3Dv1Hp%5F3opdrDpi8vpuHb7zsv%5FZA-uq1hbDo72zgb5ibLfxQcTPtb3w%5FUmIUABukPrwM.Yo8REcoO844zCP8nuZ2aL3PxB7AipeUT2yvEWXAQ-mE&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=Kindle&qid=1711550411&sprefix=kindle%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-3&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002465&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkindle-vs-nook-which-e-reader-is-best-for-you%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) without ads and $99 with ads. B&N also offers the 7.8-inch [Nook GlowLight 4 Plus for $199.99](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2002465/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-plus-barnes-noble/1143603294?ean=9780594155256), which doesn't really have a current Kindle equivalent. The old 7-inch [Kindle Oasis can be had for $239 refurbished](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Refurbished-Kindle-Oasis-Ad-Supported/dp/B07L93JZ2N/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=KJ5N9Y62WELG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NYz0UaO8Z2cg0cbLEQaI2mLady5JMBeF0SaCYgQ1J4s8%5FZW7bsmLsVssamGhAsg7yTDoYvZ01iN5joKKVIGsRZvuQ4PPNk-1h1hpR4CsnHTtsuZCUxOQmcxIceuZocYHUxxkOueU%5Fwdv8boWEFTJV1zt69oFJaqTs3RJVN9YlL2tvl5M8w2Y1rnXl25Y4Np6X1AeXTMsHnUhNpUIftDg64kE%5FyTXTlOaIpXq%5FO1amIo.1pVWpD4ud9-8BO2qU6sxGuFGTOlOJOW8pvJwkfWRxMQ&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=Kindle+oasis&qid=1711550497&sprefix=kindle+oasis%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002465&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkindle-vs-nook-which-e-reader-is-best-for-you%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen), and the larger 10-inch [Kindle Scribe costs over $300](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/dp/B09BSRTHL7/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=30MOWO9SMFM5W&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LNLIMm-wz2kRd0OALHY6Gc7-ByQ1tcnUaCYzdv0YQvgQiS4nc1UqL2Xki-40G4K-i4m%5FXQdQhDLrw6qY%5FZoI93BwQbfgh0OlLb3MpsJvaYu0JXy2Ugn1rZpLr4BwyjZlRweOItL6xJxjyADcB6hhV0tPfg3Paw7eAaVATEF2kRYSsLTRQZI%5FRls-mmwBgkGeHFeNClQSHefbY2jkH4HqaohegP-9tL81JiZxeU3ZpVg.1K8VZoOvHRZg0kR3cc33-zVS6pSFUT%5Fey6FAiww-16w&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=Kindle+scribe&qid=1711550520&sprefix=kindle+scribe%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002465&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fkindle-vs-nook-which-e-reader-is-best-for-you%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) when not discounted.

 In short, Kindles are cheaper if you're okay with lock screen ads, but Nook has the edge when you compare ad-free to ad-free models. Considering we gave the hardware crown to Kindle, you're probably better off spending the extra $10 for an ad-free Kindle.

##  Which Is Best?

![Kindle logo on a Kindle eReader.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/52648237882_f9960dac6d_o.jpg) 

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

 This is one comparison where there's a pretty big clear winner with just a couple of asterisks. [Most people will be happiest with a Kindle eReader](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/superior-10-mobile-apps-to-edit-your-face/). The Kindle Store has a much bigger selection of ebooks, audiobooks, magazines, comics, and more. They also have nicer, more premium-feeling hardware, and the experience of checking out free books from your local library is super easy. The pricing comparison is so close it's not worth factoring into the equation.

 There are only two main reasons why someone might want to choose a Nook over a Kindle. First and foremost, you don't like Amazon, and you want to stay as far away from the Amazon ecosystem as possible. If that's the case, your question should be "Nook or Kobo?" Second, you really, really like page turn buttons.

 Love it or hate it, Amazon has firmly entrenched itself at the top of the eReader market. As long as you don't mind using Amazon products, a Kindle is an excellent device for your reading needs.
