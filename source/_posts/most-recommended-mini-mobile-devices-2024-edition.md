##  What to Look for With Small Screen Phones

 Shopping for a small phone is a challenge. Most new smartphones are built with massive screens, making them difficult to slip into a pocket or purse. And once you toss a case on them, they become even more cumbersome. However, all is not lostâ€”there are still plenty of great, relatively small phones for you to consider.

 Before looking for a small phone, it's important to determine why you want a small phone and what you're willing to compromise. For example, picking up phones with tiny dimensions is possible, but you might have to forgo powerful processors and vibrant displays. Whether it's for ease of use, to cut down on weight in your pockets, or just because you prefer smaller displays, be sure to narrow down why you're shopping for these niche items.

 You may also want to consider what dimensions are a dealbreaker. For example, if you're trying to squeeze a smartphone into your favorite purse, certain sizes might be too large. This is crucial, as many smartphones are only marginally larger than others. Knowing what size you need could mean the difference between snagging the iPhone 15 Pro or opting for the less powerful (but slightly smaller) iPhone SE.

 Aside from the above, you'll want to consider all the usual factors when shopping for a smartphone. This includes battery life, processing power, display quality, and camera quality..

##  Best Small Phone Overall: [iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro)

| Pros                  | Cons                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Titanium construction | Display is still quite large |
| A17 Pro Chip          | Expensive                    |
| Premium cameras       |                              |
| Responsive OS         |                              |

 It's hard to believe, but the [iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro) is one of the smallest phones available on the market. Unlike the [iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/) and its gigantic 6.7-inch display, the iPhone 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch display, making it easier to fit in a pocket (even when you [toss a case on it](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-oppo-find-n3-flip-phone-by-drfone-android/)).

 Clocking in at 5.77 inches tall, 2.78 inches wide, and just 0.32 inches deep, the iPhone 15 Pro is surprisingly compact. It's not the smallest phone you can buy. Still, considering it gets you a Super Retina XDR display, titanium construction, and the powerful A17 Pro Chip, you're getting a lot of useful tech packed into a relatively tiny package.

 Apple didn't cut many (if any) corners with the 15 Pro, as you'll benefit from additional features like a top-of-the-line camera suite and a battery that gets you a full day of use before recharging. Of course, you'll also have access to the App Store, which is loaded with useful games and apps to keep you entertained. As long as don't mind its price, the iPhone 15 Pro is a great option for just about everyone.

| Pros                           | Cons                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Crisp camera                   | Slower than the competition |
| 120Hz display                  | Mediocre battery            |
| Good processor (for the price) |                             |
| Listed under $300              |                             |

 The [OnePlus Nord N30 5G](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU2003574&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-n30-5g) isn't the most popular phone on the planet, but its combination of pricing and size makes it a great choice for frugal shoppers. Despite its large 6.7-inch screen, it's still under three inches wide, just 0.33 inches thick, and weighs 195 grams. That's just eight grams heavier than the iPhone 15 Pro, yet you're getting a much larger screen at a much more reasonable price.

 Packing a large screen into a small frame meant that OnePlus had to make some compromises, especially considering its low price point. For one, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 5G isn't the most robust CPU on the market, though it's perfectly fine for light gaming, streaming, or scrolling through social media. And at this price point, it's a nice inclusion.

 Its battery can also run out of charge faster than the competition, so you may need to look elsewhere if you need something to get you through long workdays. However, considering that you'll get a large display with a 120Hz refresh rate and compact footprint, the Nord N30 5G is a solid choice for budget shoppers.

Best Small Budget Phone

#####  OnePlus Nord N30 5G

$250 $300 Save $50 

The OnePlus Nord N30 might not be the most exciting phone ever built, but for less than $300 you get a well-made device, with a decent camera, snappy processor and 8GB of internal RAM. If it only had a OLED display like the N20, it would be even better.

| A15 Bionic Chip                      |                   |

 The [iPhone SE (3rd Gen)](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher%5Fslug=howtogeek&u1=UUhtgUeUpU2003574&article%5Fname=The+Best+Small+Phones+of+2024&article%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-small-phones%2F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-se-3rd-generation-64gb-unlocked-black%2F6507470.p) is the smallest phone in Apple's current lineup. Its 4.7-inch screen is smaller than nearly everything on the market, making it the best option for someone seeking a device that easily fits into pockets.

 Though small, it's still built to Apple's high standards. This means you're getting a phone that feels premium, is powered by the great A15 Bionic Chip, and has a 12MP rear camera that captures great images at this price point. The overall look of the iPhone SE is a bit dated, however, as it uses large bezels at the top and bottom of the screenâ€”a key design element from the iPhones of yesteryear.

 While the iPhone SE is small, you might be surprised that it's only marginally smaller than the iPhone 15 Pro despite its 4.7-inch display. It clocks in at 5.45 inches tall, 2.65 inches wide, and 0.29 inches deep. That makes it just slightly more compact than its newer cousin. But if you need something small, this is one to keep on your shopping list.

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Great camera for selfies | External screen is very small       |
| Two displays             | Hinge may falter after extended use |
| Ultra-compact            |                                     |
| Unique design            |                                     |

 What makes the [Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Smartphone-Foldable-One-Hand/dp/B0C63KD7JP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003574&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-small-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) so compelling is the fact that it's a [foldable phone](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/step-beyond-reality-reviewing-lgs-virtual-vision-for-2024/), meaning you can flip it open to access a large interior screen or fold it closed to easily stow it in a pocket, purse, or bag. It has the portability of a flip phone with all the bleeding-edge technology from a Samsung flagship device.

 The Flip5's interior screen is large, at 6.7 inches, while the exterior display is much smaller, at 3.4 inches. That means you won't want to use the outer screen for all your tasks, but it works flawlessly to quickly check texts or other notifications. Both look fantastic in use, thanks to the AMOLED 2X technology of the main display and Super AMOLED in the exterior display.

 Because the phone folds in half, it's also great for selfies. You can prop the phone up on just about any surface and get the camera pointed at you and your friends, and because it packs a suite of great cameras and can record in up to 4K, it's the ideal choice for content creators or social media fanatics. The main drawback is the hinge's reliability, as it may run into issues after a few years of use. Aside from that, there's little to complain about with this innovative smartphone.

When closed, it is around 4 inches tall, 2 inches wide, and less than an inch thick. It's also incredibly inexpensive, with a price tag well below $100.

 But this isn't your standard smartphone. It's not even really a smartphone at all. The Nokia 2780 Flip is a modernized version of the old-school flip phones of the early 2000s, featuring a minimalist design bound to fit into even the smallest pocket. While it looks old-school, it comes with nice features such as Google Maps, 4G connectivity, and YouTube support, so it's a bit more versatile than a traditional flip phone from decades ago.

 But because this isn't a true smartphone, there are several things to be aware of before adding it to your bag. For one, navigation can be clunky, as you'll be using a numpad to type instead of a touchscreen. The screen is also incredibly small, so using the limited selection of apps can be frustrating. The Nokia 2780 Flip won't be the best fit for everyone, but shoppers seeking a small phone who donâ€™t mind giving up some niceties will find it a viable alternative to traditional smartphones.
