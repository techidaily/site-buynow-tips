## Access Exclusive Discounts - Start of the Steam Seasonal Clearance!

Steam is one of the largest game storefronts, and any opportunity we have to save money on our favorite games is always appreciated. The platform's seasonal sales are always a great time to stock up on games. Now, Steam's Spring Sale is finally here to welcome the arrival of spring, and there's a lot of deals that you might want to check out.

[Steam](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-mastering-your-media-with-vlcs-secret-features/) has opened up its Spring Sale to the public. It is now live, and it will be running through March 21st, so you only have a few days to place your purchases. A lot of titles, including games in hot demand, are currently discounted, so if you happen to have a specific game in your wishlist that you've been expecting to go down in price, now is probably the right time to check if it's discounted.

 Notably, [Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs%5FGate%5F3/), which won the Game of the Year award last year, is currently discounted from $34.99 to $31.49, a 10% discount. It's not much, but the game was already cheap, and now it's cheaper, so you might as well just hop on it while you can. [Cyberpunk 2077](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk%5F2077/)is down 50% and is now just $22.49, while [Starfield](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/) is discounted by 33% to $28.13\. [Mortal Kombat 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal%5FKombat%5F1/)is down 40% to $21, while [Diablo IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo%5FIV/)is on sale for 50% off at $34.99\. One of the best deals this time around might be [EA SPORTS FC 24](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195250/EA%5FSPORTS%5FFC%5F24/), which had its price lowered from $69.99 to a mere $13.99, making for an 80% discount. However, that game is halfway through its lifetime as EA will almost certainly release another soccer game later this year, so it's not hard to find it discounted.

 Other discounted titles include [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The%5FElder%5FScrolls%5FV%5FSkyrim%5FSpecial%5FEdition/)at $9.99, [Spider-Man: Miles Morales](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817190/Marvels%5FSpiderMan%5FMiles%5FMorales/) at $29.99, [Total War: WARHAMMER III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total%5FWar%5FWARHAMMER%5FIII/) for $24.99, and [Forza Horizon 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza%5FHorizon%5F5/) at $16.39\. Of course, Steam doesn't just have games, and a lot of the Stardock software we covered in the past (such as the Start Menu replacement, Start11) [is also discounted](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=stardock&category1=994&supportedlang=english&ndl=1). Again, all the discounts end on March 21st.
