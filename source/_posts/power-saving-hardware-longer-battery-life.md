 In the summer heat, your devices tend to drain faster, making this Anker portable charger indispensable.

 It has a built-in USB-C cable, a second USB-C port, and a USB-A port. These options ensure compatibility with basically anything that charges over USB, including headphones, laptops, phones, and watches.

 To highlight its efficiency, the charger can power up an iPhone 15 Pro from empty to approximately 60 percent in just 30 minutes. Plus, the device itself only needs a couple of hours to top up.

 Finally, it's safe for air travel, making it the perfect companion for all your summer plans.

 This ultra-portable USB-rechargeable fan from ATEngeius, measuring around 6x7 inches, is ideal for any summer EDC.

 Its flexible legs allow it to stand upright, convert into a phone stand, or attach to objects like your bike’s handlebars. With three speed settings, it can run anywhere from 5 to 20 hours, helping you stay cool and then easily fitting back into your bag.

 To save space, you need a flashlight like this one. Along with being under seven inches long, it doesn't need batteries.

 Instead, this 1000-lumen, waterproof flashlight charges its 1,200 mAh battery in the sun or via a USB cable. It even doubles as a small power bank, allowing you to transfer its sun-provided power to other USB devices.
