## Unleash Power Play with Budget-Friendly ASUS ROG Ally at Only $400

Save $100 on the ASUS ROG Ally at Best Buy and get to gaming wherever you are.

 Have you been on the fence about getting a [handheld gaming PC](https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-tech-devices-by-toms-authority-in-hardware/)? I can understandâ€”I was initially against picking one up myself since I had a [gaming laptop](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-premium-notebooks-select-the-best-for-professional-edits/) and a desktop. But a handheld PC is even more portable than (an often big and heavy) gaming laptop, and the goal of them is to make PC gaming all the more accessible on the go (or from my bed). I'm not the only one that sees the [advantages of portable PC gaming](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-utilizing-internal-screen-recording-on-huaweis-mate-1020-and-p-models-p20-p10/), either.

 While Valve may have had the first widely successful attempt at a handheld PC with the [Steam Deck](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-vivo-x100-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), ASUS' ROG Ally is nothing to sneeze at. The ROG Ally is the Steam Deck's primary competitor in the market, and for good reason. Not only are the specs generally more impressive on paper, but since the Ally runs on Windows 11, it's easier to get non-Steam games running on the system. We touch on it in our [ASUS ROG Ally review](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-and-shine-the-top-5-video-quality-tools/):

 This means that any game that runs on a Windows 11 gaming PC should run on the Ally, at least in principle. You don't have to worry about Linux compatibility layers, having access to game launchers other than Steam, or anything over and above the typical troubles that can rear up on any Windows gaming PC.

 Now, you can pick up the [AMD Ryzen Z1 model of the ASUS ROG Ally](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-ally-7-120hz-fhd-1080p-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-processor-512gb-white%2F6543664.p%3FskuId%3D6543664) for just $399.99 at Best Buy, which is $100 off and simply an incredible deal. It is important to note that this is the less powerful of the two models (the other model having the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor), and there will be [differences in performance](https://rog.asus.com/articles/rog-ally/rog-ally-z1-vs-z1-extreme-performance--features-compared/) that you'll want to keep in mind. But depending on what you play on the Ally, the performance differences may not be all that noticeable. Just be sure to do your research before pulling the trigger!
