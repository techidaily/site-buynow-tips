##  What to Look For in a Google Pixel 7 Case in 2023

 Many case options exist for your Google Pixel 7, from slim cases to wallet cases. But before you go case shopping, here are some things you should keep in mind.

 Determining your budget is a good starting point. Cases from reputable brands start from as low as $15 and go up to $50-$60\. However, it's important to remember that you don't necessarily need to spend the big bucks to get a nice case.

 Once you've settled on a price range, you should consider the amount of protection you're hoping to get from your case. Rugged cases are your best bet for top-notch protection, but they're also bulkier than other types of cases.

 Slim cases sit on the other end of the spectrum, and while they don't add too much bulk, their protection capabilities are inferior to a rugged case. That said, some thin cases can be sufficiently durable for regular users.

 Case design is another factor to consider. If you don't want to hide the bold design of the Pixel 7 behind a case, you can opt for a clear case. Its transparency will allow you to show off the phone's design and color while also protecting it. If you're looking for a more premium look, leather cases are also a solid choice.

 These are only some of the many Pixel 7 case options out there. To help you narrow your search, here are some of our top picks.

[![Spigen Rugger Armor collage](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/spigen-rugged-armor-pixel-7.jpg) Spigen](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Designed-Pixel/dp/B09YMVMSYM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term)

| Pros                                      | Cons                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ✓ Air cushions for better drop protection | ✗ Single color option |
| ✓ Raised lip to safeguard the screen      |                       |
| ✓ Wireless charging support               |                       |

 Spigen has built a reputation for producing high-quality and affordable smartphone cases. And the [Rugged Armor](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Designed-Pixel/dp/B09YMVMSYM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is an excellent example of this. It offers superior protection despite keeping a relatively slim profile.

 Made of flexible [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/) (TPU) material, the case is easy to put on or remove and provides a snug fit, further highlighted by its "Made for Google Pixel" certification. Although it isn't a particularly striking case, the Rugged Armor looks sleek, and the carbon fiber accents add to its modern aesthetic.

 Spigen has also included its Air Cushion technology, which helps it absorb the shock of bumps and drops while keeping the phone safe. Additionally, it's compatible with wireless charging, includes raised edges to protect your Pixel 7's beautiful 6.3-inch [OLED screen](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/mkv-to-sony-xperia-5-v-converter-convert-mkv-for-sony-xperia-5-v-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/), and has textured sides for a secure grip.

 The only downside is the lack of color options. The Spigen case is only available in [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Designed-Pixel/dp/B09YMVMSYM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 If you want to ditch your wallet, [VRS Design's Damda Glide Hybrid](https://www.amazon.com/VRS-DESIGN-Hybrid-Functional-Compatible/dp/B0BFC4431T?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) has you covered. It's a versatile Pixel 7 case that can store three to four cards and some cash while protecting your phone. Its card compartment uses a semi-automatic door mechanism that securely holds your cards and cash while being easy to operate.

 Built using TPU, polycarbonate, and steel, the case is sturdy and can take a beating without breaking a sweat. Plus, air pockets on the corners cushion your phone during drops.

 If that's not enough, the Damda Glide Hybrid also comes with a built-in kickstand that works in both portrait and landscape orientations to facilitate hands-free media playback.

 Unfortunately, the thickness of the card compartment makes it unsuitable for wireless charging and bulkier than regular cases, which is a small price to pay for its convenience.

| Pros                             | Cons            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| ✓ Military-grade drop protection | ✗ Stiff buttons |
| ✓ Enhanced grip and raised edges |                 |
| ✓ Lightweight design             |                 |
| ✓ Wireless charging support      |                 |

 UAG is one of the best brands in the business regarding rugged protection, so it's hard to go wrong with the [UAG Scout](https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Protective-URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR/dp/B0BFWWCYPX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). It's an impressive case built to protect your phone from everyday mishaps.

 You'll also be happy to know that it meets the military-grade drop test standards and comes with textured edges to help with grip.

 In other features, you get raised edges to safeguard the display and the camera bar, compatibility with most wireless chargers, and a lanyard loop to attach hand or neck straps. Plus, despite its incredible protection capabilities, the case weighs a little bit more than an ounce and adds just over 5mm to the overall width of the phone.

 Like the Spigen Rugged Armor, the UAG Scout is also "Made for Google Pixel" certified. As a result, you can expect this case to fit your Pixel perfectly.

 You can buy the UAG Scout in [Black](https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Protective-URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR/dp/B0BFWWCYPX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [Olive Drab](https://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Protective-URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR/dp/B0BFWYLJG9?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) color options.

 If you enjoy Pixel 7's bold design, you shouldn't have to hide it behind a case. This is where [Crave's Clear Guard](https://www.amazon.com/Crave-Clear-Guard-Shockproof-Google/dp/B0B9HWT5V1?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) comes into play. It offers the same robust protection as any other excellent case while showing off the phone's design and color.

 Its TPU construction is lightweight but capable of withstanding drops from as high as nine feet. The Clear Guard will protect your phone from scratches, bumps, drops, and other mishaps.

 You also get raised edges on the front and around the camera bar to keep those two features of your phone safe from scrapes and other minor damage.

 In other highlights, the Crave Clear Guard comes with a lifetime warranty. If you have trouble with the case, you can contact the company for a replacement.

 There are a couple of downsides. For example, the glossy finish of the case is a fingerprint magnet, so be ready to wipe down the case frequently to maintain that crystal-clear look. In addition, some people may not enjoy the prominent Crave branding on the side of the case.

 The Pixel 7 may be the smaller of the two new Google phones, but it's still a large phone. You may not want to add bulk to it by picking up a hefty case. The [Tech21 Evo Lite](https://www.amazon.com/Tech21-Google-Pixel-Evo-Lite/dp/B0B7XBBFFB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203984&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F840976%2Fbest-google-pixel-7-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is the most suitable for such a scenario. It's a thin and light case that doesn't skimp on protection.

 This case can withstand multiple drops from as high as 10 feet and comes with raised edges to protect the display and camera bar. It also features textured sides to offer enhanced grip.

 Apart from being great at protecting your phone, the Tech21 Evo Lite also comes with a special additive that makes the plastic used in the case more enticing to microorganisms found in landfills. So, when the case finally ends up in a landfill, it'll disintegrate faster than any other plastic, making it better for the environment than other cases.

 Sadly, the Tech21 Evo Lite is only available in a single color option.

This [Pixel 7 case](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=2QzUaswX1as&mid=43345&u1=UUhtgUeUpU203984&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fbellroy.com%2Fproducts%2Fleather-case-for-pixel-7%3Fcolor%3Dblack%26material%3Dleather) is no different.

 The case is built with eco-tanned leather, which will enhance your phone's look. In addition, you can choose from five colorways, including the classic [Terracotta brown](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=2QzUaswX1as&mid=43345&u1=UUhtgUeUpU203984&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fbellroy.com%2Fproducts%2Fleather-case-for-pixel-7%3Fcolor%3Dterracotta%26material%3Dleather) and [Black](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=2QzUaswX1as&mid=43345&u1=UUhtgUeUpU203984&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fbellroy.com%2Fproducts%2Fleather-case-for-pixel-7%3Fcolor%3Dblack%26material%3Dleather).
