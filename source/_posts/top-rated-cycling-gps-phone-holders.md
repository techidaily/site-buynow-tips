##  How to Shop for a Bike Phone Mount in 2023

 It might seem like a straightforward concept—buy a chunk of plastic that looks like a phone mount and can be attached to your bike, then start using it. But there's more to the conversation.

 One of the first rules is deciding how rugged you need this mount to be. Are you an easy rider and are comfortable with one hand on your handlebar? Do you like to go hard when cycling and need a more secure mount? How about a simple pouch to store your phone to protect it from the rain?

 You'll also want to consider whether you'd prefer a universal mount or one designed to work with special cases. Some manufacturers offer bike mounts with specialized smartphone cases for extra security, but those cases aren't available for every smartphone model. That's where universal mounts come into play; although they aren't specifically designed for any phone, they'll work consistently with whatever phone you have in your pocket.

 One last note: make sure the mount you buy fits your phone. Some mounts are geared toward smaller devices with screens around 6.1 inches and below, while others will comfortably fit the 6.7-inch behemoths of the world.

 That conversation gets a bit dicey if you own a folding phone, but you'll only really run into issues if you plan to, say, use a Galaxy Z Fold 5's larger display while riding your bike. So long as you stick with mounting the cover screen, you'll be good to go.

##  Best Bike Phone Mount Overall: [Bone Bike Tie 4 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Bone-Bike-Phone-Holder-Mounting/dp/B08BRNWBMR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) 

![Bone Tie 4 Pro bike mount on a road bike](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bone-tie4-mount.jpg) 

Bone 

| Pros                             | Cons                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Simple silicone loop grip design | Not suitable for very rough terrain |
| Shock-absorbing mounting pad     | Can't be rotated in place           |
| Lightweight and low-profile      |                                     |

 The [Bone Bike Tie Pro 4](https://www.amazon.com/Bone-Bike-Phone-Holder-Mounting/dp/B08BRNWBMR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) earns the top spot in this list with a combination of value for money, adaptability, ease of use, and thoughtful design. While the name is undoubtedly a bit of a mouthful, everything else about this bike phone mount is pleasantly simple and elegant.

 The Tie Pro 4 is constructed almost entirely from stretchy silicone. That makes it very adaptable to different phone sizes and can securely hold devices with displays between 4.7 and 7.2 inches. Just place your phone in the middle of the mount and stretch the loops over each corner, where they shouldn't obstruct the front camera and home button on most devices.

 It's designed to attach to the handlebar stem using a simple, secure notched strap. You can attach it elsewhere, but as the Tie Pro 4 mount doesn't rotate, you'll have to put up with a horizontal screen if you want it on your handlebars. Above the strap is a thick pad of silicone to provide shock absorption and protect your phone and bike from scratches.

 This phone mount might not be secure or protective enough for hardcore off-road mountain biking. But for the commute to work or a weekend cycle around the countryside, it's pretty hard to beat for the price.

ROCKBROS

| Pros                                  | Cons                                |

| Silicone bumpers on the phone cradle  |                                     |
| Very budget-friendly                  |                                     |

 The [ROCKBROS Bike Phone Mount](https://www.amazon.com/ROCKBROS-Motorcycle-4-5-7-1-Handlebar-Rotatable/dp/B0CB5R2J17?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a perfect choice for casual weekend cyclists and daily two-wheeled commuters alike. If you want a secure mount for your phone but don't want to spend a fortune, this is a great choice.

 It includes several features, including one-handed operation, auto-locking, and a metal-reinforced handlebar clamp, commonly only found on mounts that cost twice as much. But it also does the basics well. Silicone cushions at the corners of the phone cradle and inside the clamp protect your gear from scratches, while deep corner grips mean it should easily handle devices with chunky cases.

 The mount can be rotated 360 degrees and tilted by 30 degrees, so it's easy to find the perfect viewing angle. The whole phone holder section can also be removed from the clamp, which allows you to quickly swap it onto the optional rearview mirror arm. This is sold separately but, for around ten dollars, can really expand the mounting options.

 Considering the ROCKBROS Bike Phone Mount's price point, it's definitely not lacking in features. It might not be the most elegant-looking solution for attaching your phone to your bike, but if you can get past that hurdle, there is a lot to like.

 For mountain bike riders, there's the [Lamicall Bike Phone Holder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085DMV7XD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It has a sturdy handlebar grip and will stay put as you tear up the terrain, and the phone mount can be operated with one hand. The mount also adds a bit of protection to your smartphone to keep it safe from the elements.

 Lamicall says the mount can hold phones up to 6.8 inches, absorb shock, and rotate between vertical and horizontal orientations. The design is robust thanks to premium materials and construction, and you can get it in three colors: [Black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085DMV7XD?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Yellow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C76XGQV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Grey](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHVXLD7H?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Admittedly, the colors are mere accents on an otherwise black phone mount, and the size of the entire package is rather large. If you can get past that, it's a great option for anyone who regularly rides on rocky turf.

| Pros                              | Cons                      |

| Sturdy weatherproof silicon latch | Bulky cases might not fit |

| 360-degree swivel                 |                           |

 If you need a sturdy phone mount to strap to a motorcycle or electric bicycle, the [Roam Bike Phone Mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWDCSIZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is right up your alley. It offers a durable design that securely attaches to the handlebars on your bike, and the silicon net that holds your phone is weather-resistant to stop accelerated aging.

 The grip for your handlebars is impact-resistant, so it won't bounce around if you hit a bump, and the mount can swivel 360 degrees.

 The mount itself can fit devices up to 3.6 inches wide, but if your phone is particularly thick, thanks to a bulky case, there's a chance it won't fit in the silicon net. Beyond that, it's a rock-solid phone mount for your bike designed to perform well while out on the open road.

| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Weatherproof design                          | Can't fit phones much larger than 6.5-inches |
| Plenty of storage for all of your belongings |                                              |

 A bike phone mount that doubles as a storage bag for things like keys, your wallet, and other small items can be exceptionally convenient. For anyone looking to pick one up, you should check out the [Rock Bros Bike Phone Mount Bag](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QKP848?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU203525&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F850502%2Fbest-bike-phone-mounts%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 It sits right in the middle of your bike, so it stays secure, and it props your phone up a bit in case you have to pull up a map to see where you're going. The bag is water and dust-proof and can store almost anything you'd need for a ride.

 What's more, there's a tiny flap on the bottom, so you can route headphones to your phone if you're still living that wired life. There are reflectors on either side so cars can spot you in the dark, and you can use your phone's touchscreen through the plastic protector.

 Dealing with a bag to store your phone can be tedious, especially if you want to pull over quickly and type out a text message. It's also not ideal for larger phones with screens over 6.5 inches or are especially thick, thanks to a bulky case. Regardless, it's a solid pick-up if you've decided you need a bag mounted to your bike.
