## Best Streaming Box Showdown: Comparing Roku vs Amazon Fire TV Stick for Ultimate Entertainment Experience

Streaming sticks are the best way to add streaming services to your TV, monitor, or laptop.

 These compact devices plug into any available HDMI port and allow you to quickly access a variety of streaming services and access plenty of helpful apps and games.

 Even if you already have a smart TV, the interface provided by these devices makes them invaluable, allowing you to easily swap between streaming services and search for media without being forced to fumble through an on-screen keyboard.

 Here, we compare some of the most popular 4K models from Amazon and Roku to see who comes out on top.

## Video Quality

 The quality of the stream is the most critical aspect when weighing these two models. Thankfully, both options support[4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) video playback. Both the Roku and Fire TV Stick also support[Dolby Vision and HDR10+](https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427) .

![Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lQbaifaElvadbmSE1QgG_8Ablwk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/http___image.roku.com_w_rapid_images_undefined_f2f60a9b-d466-4dde-aabb-f44392e24f1f-3f9e5d966ef14b6c8892ac8e00b16210.png)

 Neither device has built-in Ethernet connectivity, but both come equipped with 802.11 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which provide all the necessary bandwidth for seamlessly streaming at 4K.

## Design

 Unlike Google's Chromecast devices, the Roku and Fire TV Stick adhere to a straightforward stick adapter design, allowing them to tuck themselves behind almost any screen.

 One minor consideration, however, is while the Roku Stick is marginally smaller than Amazon's option, it doesn't come packaged with an extender dongle, meaning that if you have limited clearance around your TV's HDMI port, you may have some issues with the Roku out of the box.

 The remotes for both models are similar in shape, with the Firestick remote being a little slimmer and more modern in its aesthetic. Each has dedicated volume and playback controls and multi-function directional buttons that run on AAA batteries. Both remotes also include quick access buttons that let you quickly switch between streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ (these options vary).

 Each streaming stick uses a separate micro-USB adapter for power and can be connected to either a wall outlet or directly to your TV for power.

## Features

 Both options include built-in Wi-Fi, meaning they don't need to be hard-wired for anything to work, just an active wireless connection in your home. While they both include voice search, the Fire TV Stick 4K is slightly more responsive. It has[Alexa](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107) support, making it just a dash of added functionality, especially if you're already an owner of any of Amazon's smart hubs.

 Both remotes can also substitute for your handy TV remote. The baked-in Bluetooth connectivity for each device effectively replaces the 3.5mm audio jack in some previous versions, allowing you to wirelessly pair headphones and listen to the TV without disturbing others.

 Mobile apps are available for both devices but drastically differ in their approach. The Roku app is easily the more impressive of the two, serving as an ad-hoc remote if your original happens to go missing and allowing you to quickly search for apps and media using your phone's keyboard.

 The Fires TV Stick app offers the primary home, menu, and back buttons, allowing you to perform a quick voice search, but it lacks the private listening feature offered on Roku.

 The Fire TV Stick does have an additional barrier to set up, requiring an Amazon account before you're up and running. While it isn't needed, the Fire Stick does its best to nudge you towards an Amazon Prime subscription if you don't already have one.

## Channels / Apps

 While all the most popular streaming services are available on both devices, there are differences. Some estimates say the Roku has nearly 10,000 more apps than Amazon's streaming stick.

 The bottom line here is unless you're looking for a very particular game or app, it's most likely available on either device.

## Final Verdict: Roku Takes the Prize

 Both players are the same price, $50, so choosing one should depend on what you expect from your streaming device in terms of available apps and channels.

 The answer is evident if you're already living in the Amazon ecosystem: the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k/dp/B0BP9MDCQZ?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5088017%7Cnb2692bccb8df4ddea9f223f2254526e412%7C)

 However, the Roku platform hosts a more extensive library of apps and channels. It has a more versatile companion app, making the Roku Streaming Stick 4K the clear winner in our matchup. (Unless you need Alexa functionality built into your remote.)
