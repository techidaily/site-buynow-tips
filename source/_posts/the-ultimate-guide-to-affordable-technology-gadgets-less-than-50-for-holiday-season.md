 Charging has become more and more important as we gain more gadgets. Anything that makes charging easier would be an excellent yet inexpensive gift.

 The [Anker 32W 2 Port Charger](https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-PowerPort-Foldable/dp/B08M5C86NL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208328&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761224%2Fbest-gifts-under-50%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) has both a [USB-C](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-lenovo-screen-capture-tools-effortlessly/) and [USB-A](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exploring-the-full-features-sony-fdr-x1000-model/) port, so you can charge different devices easily without fishing around for a different wall charger or carrying around a portable charger. Two devices can also be charged at the same time.

 Alongside that, it can also charge an [iPhone 13](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/play-mkv-movies-on-moto-g24-is-it-possible-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/) up to three times faster than your standard plug. After all, efficiency is a great gift---never think otherwise.

 Some people can't go to sleep without the right ambiance. For some, that's complete darkness and silence, but for others, that means a soft light and some good music.

 The [MRCOOL Bedside Table Lamp](https://www.amazon.com/MRCOOL-Bedside-Bluetooth-Speaker-Night/dp/B075RVY1K7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208328&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761224%2Fbest-gifts-under-50%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a neat little lamp and speaker combo that can set the nighttime mood with a comforting light and good audio. This device is touch-activated, has different levels of light in an uncountable number of colors, and is easy to connect a smartphone to thanks to Bluetooth.

 It can even set a timer to make sure the lamp turns off and is not using more power than needed, making it great for falling asleep.

![writing tablet on blue background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/YYTFY-LCD-Writing-Tablet.jpg) 

YYTFY

 A pad of paper is one of the most useful things anyone could have, but they don't exactly make a great gift. So what if someone took that simple concept but gave it a good tech spin?

 The [YYTFY LCD Writing Tablet](https://www.amazon.com/High-Tech-Function-Electronic-Reusable-Birthday/dp/B08L8RH222?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208328&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761224%2Fbest-gifts-under-50%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is exactly that. This tablet has a 12-inch LCD pressure-sensitive screen that is incredibly easy to write or draw on. It's a perfect gift for someone who likes to take notes, doodle to keep themselves occupied, or just write things down as a reminder.

 It's also way better than a pad of paper because it's reusable. This gift helps to save the environment and your giftee from having sheets of paper everywhere!

BREIS

 If you're looking to buy something that's more on the cool but silly end of the gift spectrum, this gift is perfect.

 The [Breis Mini LED Clock Fan](https://www.amazon.com/Temperature-Display-Function-Silver-Warranty/dp/B07S16QQJL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208328&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761224%2Fbest-gifts-under-50%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a small, flexible USB fan that not only offers a bit of airflow but also shows the time on its rapidly rotating blades. It's the kind of cool desk toy that offers some use as well.

 That's all it does, but the fan is just neat, you know? At just $20, it's also a perfect stocking stuffer.

Fugest

 Gifts can just be gifts, sometimes. It's easy to fall into the trap of the idea that everything has to have a use, but that doesn't need to be true.

 Sometimes the best gift ideas are the ones like [Fugest Floating Globe](https://www.amazon.com/FUGEST-Magnetic-Levitation-Floating-Globe/dp/B083NY5LVP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208328&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761224%2Fbest-gifts-under-50%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). This is a giant C shape device that uses magnets to suspend a globe in midair. It doesn't have a "use", but it can be rotated by blowing on it, and it just looks really cool.

 The floating globe is one of those gifts that'll impress everyone who sees it, and honestly, that's enough to be worth it.

The [Roku Express 4K+](https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Wireless-Controls/dp/B0916TKFF2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208328&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F761224%2Fbest-gifts-under-50%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) helps bring all of those services under the Roku smart TV OS, and also offers 4K resolution that'll make everything look great.
