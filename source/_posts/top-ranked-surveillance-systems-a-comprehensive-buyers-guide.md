##  What to Look For In a Security Camera in 2024

 A modern security camera should be easy to set up and support high-resolution video, for clear and detailed footage. It's also important for these cameras to have night vision, so it can catch movement and possible intruders at all hours of the day.

 A wide-angle lens covers a broader field of view, reducing the number of cameras needed for comprehensive coverage. Therefore, consider security cameras with wide-angle coverage, especially for larger properties.

 Security cameras also feature motion detection, with alerts, to notify you whenever someone or something comes within range. The best security cameras even feature two-way audio and a warning siren to scare off people or animals that venture too close.

 If you are looking for an outdoor camera, go for [weatherproof](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) cameras, with an IP65 or IP68 rating. Since outdoor cameras need to deal with adverse weather conditions (and even severe temperatures depending on where you live), they need to be able to withstand that and continue to work. If our pick below doesn't suit your needs, you can check out our [best outdoor security camera roundup](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pixels-and-players-advanced-tactics-for-recording-gaming/) for more choices.

 Making sure your camera stays powered on is also important. Solar-powered cameras can let you set and forget about charging them, but if you’re in an area that’s cloudy or your house is in a shaded area, a battery-powered or wired camera would serve you better.

 Storage is also one of the [key factors to look for in a security camera](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/latest-toshiba-driver-updates-for-windows-pcs-free-downloads-available/). You can choose to store your surveillance footage in the cloud for a monthly fee or on a removable SD card. The former may offer more storage and more privacy, but may be targeted by hackers, while the latter may be easily lost or stolen.

 Smart integration is also desirable if you want or already have a smart home. In addition, some of the best security cameras offer facial recognition as well as tamper-proofing to prevent theft.

 This is a lot to keep in mind, but we've done a lot of the research for you. The security cameras will suit most needs, so let's dive in.

 If you’re looking for a great indoor security camera, you can’t do much better than [Blink's Mini Indoor Security Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-White-3Cam/dp/B08PBR83NM/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU906906&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F755585%2Fbest-security-camera%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which balances ease of use with price to make it the best security camera for most people.

 For starters, the Mini Indoor Security Camera is easy to set up. Simply plug it into an outlet, download the [Blink app](http://blinkforhome.com/blink-app) on Android or iOS, and walk through the instructions to connect the camera to Wi-Fi.

 The Blink Mini supports a 110-degree field of view, which should be able to adequately cover the inside of most rooms, allowing you to easily monitor your children or pets as they move around your home. It supports motion detection with alerts and allows you to customize motion detection zones and motion detection sensitivity within those zones, plus the length of motion-detected clips.

 With the Blink Mini’s two-way audio feature, you can easily communicate with your family or call out your cat just before it pushes your favorite ceramic plate off the countertop. You can also control the camera with voice commands via Alexa.

 Blink's Mini camera supports HD recording (1080p at 30fps), which ensures that nothing will be blurry should you need the footage. It doesn’t matter whether it’s night or day either, as you can still see everything thanks to its night vision abilities. However, it only records on-demand (5 to 90 minutes) and does not offer free cloud storage, but with the [Sync Module 2](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU906906&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F755585%2Fbest-security-camera%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) (sold separately), you can save and share clips locally. You can't install an SD card either, so you'll need the Module 2 for local sharing.

 You can get the Blink Mini Indoor camera in [black](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-White-3Cam/dp/B09Y52VM8W/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU906906&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F755585%2Fbest-security-camera%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) or [white](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-White-3Cam/dp/B08PBR83NM/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU906906&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F755585%2Fbest-security-camera%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and there are a variety of bundle options so you can get exactly what you need for your home.

 Trying to find a reliable budget security camera can be tricky. Even if you don't have a lot of cash to spare, you still want something that will keep watch over your home, give you clear video, and won't leak your data. Thankfully, the [TP-Link Tapo C120 Security Camera](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Tapo-%F0%9D%97%98%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%98%80-%F0%9D%97%96%F0%9D%97%B5%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%97%B2-C120/dp/B0CH45HPZT?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU906906&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F755585%2Fbest-security-camera%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) does all that and more.

 This small security camera works well both indoors and outdoors, and give crisp 2K video, wherever you place it. Initial installation is easy, with a magnetic base you can stick anywhere. There is no need to screw the camera in, which makes it great for renters.

 TP-Link also includes people, pet, and package detection for free—something that other companies sometimes hide behind subscriptions. However, there are other features locked behind the [Tapo Care](https://www.tapo.com/us//tapocare/) subscription, including a 30-day clip history. You can store footage locally on a microSD card, so it's up to you whether the additional features are worth $35 a year.

 Given the low price of the camera, with a listing price of $40, the C120 is nearly perfect, but as with any product, there are some flaws. The main sticking point is users reporting [issues with connectivity](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22X3827L5NUGX?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU906906&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F755585%2Fbest-security-camera%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which can be frustrating during set up. However, this isn't an experience for all users, so if you have a steady Wi-Fi or phone signal, setting up the C120 should go smoothly.

 Not everyone likes wires or having to deal with the hassles of wiring. If you’re looking for the best wireless security cameras for your property, go for the [Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Essential-Spotlight-Wire-Free-VMC2330B/dp/B08B3B3LQ3/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU906906&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F755585%2Fbest-security-camera%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 The Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera is so easy to mount and set up that you can have it up and running in a minute. All you need is a stable Wi-Fi connection and the companion Arlo Essential app for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU906906/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlo.app&hl=en&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arlo-secure-home-security/id1459289784), and the app will walk through the setup for you. It's also compatible with Alexa, HomeKit, Google Assistant, and SmartThings, and can even be controlled by voice, so Arlo made sure the Essential Spotlight camera was easy to use.

 Arlo's security camera supports 1080p recording, providing clear footage with color night vision across a 130-degree field of view. It also has a spotlight feature that lights up once a subject steps into focus, which can serve as a deterrent to intruders. You can also use the clear two-way audio on the Arlo Essential Spotlight Camera to ward off unwanted visitors, or simply speak to whoever is in view.

 You can also get alerts for motion detection, but you'll need an [Arlo Secure](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/arlosecure.html) subscription for more granular control over motion detection and notifications, including separate notifications for pets, people, or vehicles.
