##  The Best Tech Gifts for the Geek That Has it All

 As adults, many of us take advantage of any disposable income to treat ourselves to the things we couldn't afford as kids on an allowance. It means that whatever someone is into is often tricky to buy for them because they've already invested their disposable income into it.

 That's especially true when someone adores tech. It can make gift shopping exhausting because you're never 100% certain you're buying something that's not already owned---and asking can ruin the surprise!

 We've scoured the web to find an assortment of gifts that most people just won't have thought of, so we've got your holiday shopping covered.

##  Pursonic UV Toothbrush Sanitizer: Clean the Cleaner

![Pursonic toothbrush sanitizer on pink background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/toothbrush-sanitizer.jpg) 

Pursonic

 Oral hygiene is essential to everyone. In a gift-giving sense, this offers a chance to buy someone who loves a cool gadget they're unlikely to already own. The [Pursonic UV Toothbrush Sanitizer](https://www.amazon.com/Pursonic-S1-Portable-Toothbrush-Sanitizer/dp/B004ZXN3XO?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a neat little device that kills off bacteria on a toothbrush, making teeth brushing that much more effective.

 It uses ultraviolet (UV) light to kill germs. Not only does it automatically turn on when the toothbrush is in the container, but it also automatically turns off after five minutes, so you don't need to worry about the device running itself out of batteries if you're not minding it.

##  Samsung Qi Wireless Charger and Sanitizer: Charge and Clean Your Phone

![Samsung sanitizer surrounded by devices](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/samsung-uv-sanitizer.jpg) 

Samsung

 We've all become a bit more aware of how dirty things can be over the last two years, so it's good to keep things we often touch clean. [Mashable reports](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208235/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x00otjSL6GQ) that mobile phones can be dirtier than toilets because of how often we touch them, so it's an important priority to clean a smartphone regularly.

 Well, you can remove the worry of germs for someone with the [Samsung Qi Wireless Charger and UV Sanitizer](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Electronics-Wireless-Charger-Sanitizer/dp/B08BJFRS78?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). Not only does this device destroy germs with a shockingly high rate of success, but it can also charge a Qi wireless-compatible phone at the same time.

 Samsung's sanitizer can also be used with other gadgets and items that fit inside, so it has plenty of use beyond just a phone sanitizer!

![21AiIU3h-7L._SL500_-2](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/21aiiu3h-7l-_sl500_-2.jpg) 

#####  Samsung Qi Wireless Charger and UV Sanitizer

Help them keep their phone as clean as possible, and keep it charged.

##  Rocketbook Smart Notebook: High-Tech Note Taking

![person writing in rocketbook](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/student-gifts-rocketbook.jpg) 

Rocketbook

 If your giftee is someone that's perpetually attached to a pad of paper, then this gift is for them.

 The [Rocketbook Wave Smart Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Rocketbook-Wave-Smart-Notebook-Executive/dp/B01GTYVEHI?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a relatively standard-looking notebook on the outside. It has 80 pages and can be used just like any other notebook. The difference comes from what it does once the note-taking is done, though.

 There's a Rocketbook app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/rocketbook-app/id1036898971) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208235/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rb.rocketbook&hl=en%5FGB&gl=US) that can be used to upload handwritten notes to a few different services like Google Drive and Slack, which is an excellent way to have notes easily on hand while still being able to handwrite them.

 But that's not all. Once the notebook is full, or someone is simply done with the Rocketbook, it can be placed into a microwave to remove the writing from it. This smart notebook is also reusable and overall is a great gift.

![41hFNYEu2RL._SL500_-1](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/41hfnyeu2rl-_sl500_-1.jpg) 

#####  Rocketbook Wave Smart Notebook

Milwaukee

 Tech isn't just an indoor thing! The [Milwaukee Hoodie Heated Jacket](https://www.amazon.com/Milwaukee-Hoodie-Lithium-Ion-Heated-Jacket/dp/B01N0MZJXW?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a fascinating and incredibly comfortable bit of clothing that not only protects from the wind but also keeps the wearer warm by heating them up.

 It lasts for up to six hours, has three different heat settings, and is washer and dryer safe, despite being powered by a Redlithium battery. It's a bit pricey, but if your geek giftee is out in the cold a lot, Milwaukee's jacket is practically priceless.

##  DJI Osmo Pocket: A Livestreamer's Best Friend

![Person using Osmo Pocket with phone](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/omso.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Osmo

 Many people are really into [modern-day Vlogging](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-terranomes-uncovering-treasure-in-virtual-landscapes/), which takes place on [TikTok](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-efficiently-capturing-professional-movies-on-your-windows-pc/), YouTube, and other social media platforms.

 If you're buying a gift for one of these people, then the [DJI Osmo Pocket](https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Stabilizer-integrated-Attachable-Smartphone/dp/B07KVV1W5S/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) will make them happy. This fancy little camera has a 3-axis gimbal stabilizer and an integrated 12-[megapixel camera](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). It can be attached to different smartphones for ease of use and can even record in 4K at 60 frames per second.

 Most importantly, the Osmo Pocket takes beautiful pictures and videos, and it's as light as a feather too. Anyone looking to shoot great video or capture their life will be more than happy with the Osmo Pocket.

##  Philips SmartSleep Wake-up Light: Make Mornings Better

![Person using Philips wake up light](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/philips-wake-up-light.jpg) 

Philips

 Most aren't morning people. But, the reason for that could well be that we're just using the wrong alarms to wake up to.

 The [Philips SmartSleep Wake-up Light](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Simulation-Headspace-Subscription-HF3520/dp/B0093162RM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a fancy bedside light that can simulate a sunset, sunrise, and use one of five different natural sounds to wake someone up. Not only that but the lamp can also be used as an FM radio, in case that helps your giftee sleep at night.

 This wake-up light also includes a helpful snooze button. Nobody's going to turn into a morning person overnight after all.

![416+pm4GweL._SL500_-4](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/416-pm4gwel-_sl500_-4.jpg) 

#####  Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light

Help them wake up with a gentle light, some nice noises, and a smile.

[$109 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Simulation-Headspace-Subscription-HF3520/dp/B0093162RM) 

##  Wacaco Minipresso: Coffee on the Go

![espresso maker being used outside](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wacaco-espresso-maker.jpg) 

Wacaco

 Sometimes people need an extra shot of coffee to get through the day. Or through a road trip. Or through anything, really.

 The [Wacaco Minipresso](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VTA9F6U/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a handy little device that only needs boiling water to make espresso on the go. It doesn't use power either---it's all manual operation. Just make sure the person you're buying for also has [an excellent thermos](https://www.amazon.com/THERMOS-Stainless-Beverage-Bottle-Ounce/dp/B08JX32JHP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) to keep said boiling water in, and they can make an expresso anywhere.

![415AEx88VML._SL500_-1](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/415aex88vml-_sl500_-1.jpg) 

#####  Wacaco Minipresso

A perfect espresso on the go. All they need to do is add water and squeeze. 

[$55 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VTA9F6U/) 

##  Ember Smart Mug: Keep Things Hot

![Ember Mug next to breakfast plate](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ember-mug-lifestyle.jpg) 

Ember

 We realize that the idea of buying someone a mug for the holidays feels a bit low effort, but bear with us---this particular mug is awesome.

 The [Ember Temperature Control Smart Mug 2](https://www.amazon.com/Ember-Black-Ceramic-Mug-Gen/dp/B07NQRM6ML?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is an incredible little device that can keep hot beverages at the desired temperature for up to 90 minutes on a full charge.

 However, if your giftee keeps the cup on the charging coaster, then they can enjoy a hot cup of coffee or tea all day, without ever needing to put it in the microwave. In short, this is an excellent choice for coffee and tea drinkers.

##  Jackyled Balance Lamp: Light-Giving Desk Toy

![Jackyled Balancing Lamp turned on](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/balance-lamp.jpg) 

Jackyled

 Having a good light source is incredibly useful, but there's no reason that has to be the only function when there are so many cool options available.

 The [Jackyled Balance Lamp](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0855V1QG6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a fascinating device that turns on when the two central balls are put together. The lamp can also be used with different light settings and brightness to ensure it's giving off the perfect light for whatever the person is doing.

 Then, when they're done, they can turn the light off by just moving the lower ball down a bit. It's quirky and an eye-catcher, but also very practical. It's a perfect gift if you're truly stumped on what to get the geek in your life.

##  Light Up Electronic Word Clock: A New Meaning To Reading a Clock

![Word clock on table](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/word-clock.jpg) 

Sharper Image

 There are many ways to tell the time, but most people opt for a digital clock nowadays. If you're looking for a more interesting time-based gift for someone you love, then we suggest the [Sharper Image Light Up Electronic Word Clock](https://www.amazon.com/SHARPER-Electronic-Display-Adapter-Contemporary/dp/B07CD7S9PZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208235&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F763016%2Fgifts-for-geeks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 This clock is incredibly unusual---rather than having hands or even alphanumerics on it, it is a grid of different letters. These then light up to tell the user the time using actual words. Basically, whoever uses the Word Clock can literally read the time. It's pretty cool!

![51CgTIuAX+L._SL500_-1](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/51cgtiuax-l-_sl500_-1.jpg)
