##  What to Look For in a PS5 SSD in 2023

 Not every SSD is compatible with the PS5, and any storage options you choose should have a specific list of traits to work inside the Sony console. This can be confusing if you're new to SSDs and have never had to buy one or install one yourself.

 Chances are you are using a phone or computer that utilizes an SSD, or [solid-state drive](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-gradual-glide-out-technique-for-audio-in-adobe-premiere-pro/), for high-speed storage and overall performance. The PS5 isn't any different with its built-in 1TB SSD. The problem is that SSDs generally come in smaller capacities than hard drives. Combined with the increasing size of video games (some reaching over 100 GBs in size), you'll either have to be diligent about what you install or save yourself the headache and get an expansion SSD.

 Sony breaks down what it expects of your SSD on [the company's support page](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/). Most of these specifications, like the interface and socket type, are hard to miss when buying an SSD. But the SSD's speed and size are where things get tricky. Sony recently announced that PS5 supports SSDs up to 8TB in size, so be sure to stick to that limit. Go above it, and you'll run into compatibility issues.

 The PS5 requires an internal SSD with a 5,550MB/s or faster read speed. They must also be at or under 25 mm wide and 11.25 mm thick so it actually fits in the console. Finally, your SSD needs a heatsink to withstand the high temperatures in the PS5 case.

 Here's the problem—not every SSD comes with a heatsink. Buying and installing heatsinks on your own is possible, but it's a barrier that many won't be interested in overcoming, given the tight space requirements. That's why all the SSDs below come with heatsinks—make sure you purchase the right version of our recommendations, and you're good!

 As with most SSDs, especially [M.2](https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-elite-mobile-filming-tech-for-iphones/) ones, you should look for fast sustained [read and write speeds](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-total-takeover-of-powerdirector-with-our-2024-review/) around 5,500MB/s to 7,000MB/s. This leads to certain games loading in graphics faster, like open-world titles. It also means booting up games and apps will be faster, not to mention the higher transfer speeds.

 SSDs measure [random read and write speeds](https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-xiaomi-mi-smart-band-4-fitness-tracker-review-best-value-option/), which in games come up more often than sustained ones. These are called input/output operations per second, or IOPS. Generally, you want these to also be fast, clocking in at above 500,000\. All the SSDs below hit these numbers easily.

 So with this knowledge in hand, let's get into our picks.

Western Digital

| Pros                       | Cons        |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Fast read and write speeds | A bit bulky |
| Solid price                |             |
| Optional heat sink         |             |

 The [WD SN850X](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Heatsink/dp/B0B7CPSN2K?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is unbelievably fast. It's not quite as consistently speedy as the [Seagate FireCuda 530](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0977LW48F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which is our pick for the fastest PS5 SSD, but it handles just about any task your PS5 may throw at it with ease.

 It helps that WD's SSD was made explicitly with gaming in mind. Most of this SSD's resources went into creating blazing read and write speeds, making almost any type of game you play run smoothly. The only downside? You might not have enough time to grab a drink during loading screens anymore.

 Specifically, the SN850X uses a dynamic method of storing data before properly writing it to the SSD so that the entire process feels faster to you. This is WD's nCache 4.0 technology for SLC caching in play. Don't fret over the confusing names, though; all it means is this SSD makes downloading and installing large games or apps a breeze by doing extra work behind the scenes.

 Combine that with its 7,300MB/s sequential read speed and 6,300MB/s write speed, and the WD SN850X is a robust storage solution. Finally, it will fit perfectly inside your Sony PS5 and comes with a heatsink.

 The SN850X is available in [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Heatsink/dp/B0B7CPSN2K?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Heatsink/dp/B0B7CKZGN6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [4TB](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU208593/https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-black-sn850x-nvme-ssd#WDS400T2X0E) models, with the option of a heat sink for all but the 4TB version.

Corsair

| Pros                                          | Cons                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1TB Model is under $200                       | 2TB and 4TB models are expensive |
| The heatspreader ensures SSD doesn't overheat |                                  |
| Built specifically for PS5 requirements       |                                  |

 Oftentimes when you see a budget product, you need to be prepared to make sacrifices to save a bit of money. But with the [Corsair MP600 PRO LPX](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2MW21F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), you're able to get a quality PS5 SSD while saving some cash.

 The Corsair SSD can get up to 7,100MB/s sequential read and 6,800MB/s sequential write speeds, which is blazingly fast. However, these high speeds are reserved for the higher capacity [4TB model](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2N9QGQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which is anything but budget.

 If you're looking to save money while upgrading your PS5, you'll have to deal with the lower sequential write speeds of the lower-capacity models. For the [500GB](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2NL53M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) model, the write speed is down to 3,500MB/s, with the [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2MW21F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) we recommend being at 5,800MB/s for the write speed.

 While you do sacrifice the faster speeds compared to other SSDs on this list, Corsair also includes a heatsink in the MP600, so you can be sure it won't overheat in the console and fail. For the price, that's a great feature to have.

 The Corsair MP600 PRO LPX is available in [500GB](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2NL53M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2MW21F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2NCFS7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [4TB](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2N9QGQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models, with the 1TB model offering a great balance of specs and price.

Best Budget PS5 SSD

Corsair's PS5 SSD is built specifically for the console, so you can enjoy fast speeds and an easy installation for less.

[$100 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B09Q2MW21F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) [See at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fcorsair__mp600_pro_l%2F6495944.p%3FskuId%3D6495944)

Sabrent

| Pros                       | Cons               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Reasonable price           | Lesser-known brand |
| Heatsink included          |                    |
| Fast read and write speeds |                    |

 Sabrent may not be as well-known as other brands on this list, but its [4TB Rocket 4 Plus SSD](https://www.amazon.com/4TB-SSD-Heatsink-PS5-SB-RKT4P-PSHS-4TB/dp/B09G2P4PYP?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an admirable companion for your PS5\. Along with a reasonable price and fast speeds, it includes a heatsink to protect your console from damage.

 Like all PS5-compatible SSDs, this one is built to specific standards. The console requires speeds of at least 5,500MB/s, but Sabrent went above and beyond by building the Rocket 4 Plus with 7,100MB/s read speeds and 6,600MB/s write speeds. In other words, it should be impossible to tell the difference between running content on the native SSD and this one.

 If you don't mind shopping for brands that aren't as popular, Sabrent has a lot to offer. It even comes with an installation guide and thermal tape to help you get it running without any hiccups. And with 4TB of space, you shouldn't have to delete any games ahead of a big launch.

| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Fast read and write performance                  | Higher capacities can get pricey |

 The [Seagate FireCuda 530](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0977LW48F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) returns on this list as the fastest PS5 SSD because nothing else can touch its penchant for sustained read and write speeds.

 This SSD makes games and apps load near-instantly with its 7,300MB/s read and 6,000MB/s write speeds. It's 800,000 and 1,000,000 read and write IOPS speeds don't slouch either. All these numbers mean that when you toss the FireCuda 530 into your Sony PS5, it'll not only work out of the box with its included heatsink, it'll do its job as quickly as possible.

 Part of the joy of the new consoles in the past was the reduced loading times. The FireCuda 530 does a great job of improving performance while boosting storage capacity. The budget price is nothing to scoff at, either.

 The Firecuda is available in [500GB](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0977KZN4L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [1TB](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0977LW48F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [2TB](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0977K2C74?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [4TB](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0977K3N1M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) models.

Best Fast PS5 SSD

#####  Seagate FireCuda 530

The Seagate FireCuda 530 is a blazing-fast SSD that will handle any PS5 game or app you throw at it.

[$143 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Internal-Solid-State/dp/B0977LW48F?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) [See at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fseagate-firecuda-530-4tb-internal-ssd-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-with-heatsink-for-ps5%2F6474701.p%3FskuId%3D6474701)

| Pros                       | Cons      |
| -------------------------- | --------- |
| Heatsink included          | Expensive |
| Fully compatible with PS5  |           |
| Five-year limited warranty |           |

 Now that PS5 consoles support 8TB SSDs, anyone with a massive (and ever-growing) library will want to check out the [Addlink A95 8TB SSD with Heatsink](https://www.amazon.com/Addlink-Storage-Expansion-Maximum-Internal/dp/B0CJ2MN7NC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's not cheap, but it's a great way to futureproof your console and ensure you're not rushing to free up space before the launch of a new title.

 The big selling point of the drive is its included heatsink, which means you won't have to worry about your console overheating during intense gaming sessions. It also boasts speeds up to 7,000MB/s, allowing it to run just as fast as your PS5's built-in SSD. That's well above Sony's recommended specs, so you know it'll work flawlessly with your PS5.

 Other great features include a five-year warranty, additional monitoring skills when used on PC (thanks to the [Addlink Toolbox](https://www.addlink.com.tw/supports)), and a slick design that'll have you wishing your PS5 used a transparent faceplate. Remember, you'll need to update your console to software version 23.02-08.00.00 to use the 8TB SSD, so be sure to do so before springing for this massive drive.

| Pros                            | Cons               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Very fast read and write speeds | A little expensive |
| Compact size                    |                    |
| 5-year warranty                 |                    |

 Please note that your PlayStation 5 cannot play PS5 games stored on an external SSD. An external SSD can be used for storage of PS5 games, however, and the PS5 can also play PS4 games stored on an external drive. If you want to have more storage that allows you to directly play PS5 games, you'll need to [install an internal PS5 SSD](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/iphone-android-which-has-the-better-youtube-experience/).

 If you want to keep your SSD outside your PS5 and don't want to fuss with the installation process, an external SSD is a good choice. The [WD\_Black P50 Game Drive](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-Portable-External-Compatible/dp/B07YFGTDV4?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent option for that primarily because it's built for gaming.

 The P50 Game Drive brings 2,000MB/s read and write speeds, which is fast for an external drive. The ability to maintain that speed is essential for transferring games to your PS5 or playing PS4 games directly off the drive. In terms of IOPS (input/output operations per second) speeds, the drive hits around 3,900 read and 8,500 write speeds, [according to reviews](https://www.storagereview.com/review/wd%5Fblack-p50-game-drive-ssd-review). That puts it above many other external SSDs and is more than powerful enough to keep up with the PS5's demand.

 The WD\_Black P50 Game Drive is also priced well for how fast and compatible it is with the PlayStation 5\. You won't find other external drives that can match its speeds. For improved speeds, you'll have to go with an internal SSD. This is the drive to get the absolute best performance for storing media and games.

 We recommend the 1TB model below, but the P50 is available in up to [4TBs](https://www.amazon.com/WD%5FBlack-Drive-Portable-External-Compatible/dp/B08V8THXNL?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU208593&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F756323%2Fbest-ps5-ssd%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) of storage.

## FAQ

### How do I install an SSD into a PS5?

 Installing an NVMe SSD into a PS5 is easy enough for just about anyone to accomplish...as long as you know your way around under your console's hood. Check out our full guide on[installing an NVMe drive in your PlayStation 5](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/iphone-android-which-has-the-better-youtube-experience/) for more info.

### What SSDs are compatible with a PS5?

 While many SSDs are compatible with the PS5, some form factors are not. To upgrade your console's storage, you'll want to look for an M.2 NVMe SSD [rather than a SATA alternative](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/accelerate-windows-1n-1-effective-solutions-for-enhancing-system-speed-and-responsiveness/). All drives featured in this roundup are compatible with the PlayStation 5.

### Do I need a heat sink with a PS5 SSD?

 No, you do not technically need a heat sink with your SSD. A [test run by Tom's Hardware](https://tools.techidaily.com) found that removing the SSD cover, even without a heat sink in place, was enough heat dissipation to maintain comfortable temperatures while in use. However, a heat sink will certainly aid in keeping your SSD cool, calm, and collected during long or resource-hungry gaming sessions.

### How many SSD slots does the PS5 have?

 The PS5 offers one SSD expansion slot with support for up to 8TB of storage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Can an external SSD play PS5 games?

 While it may surprise you, the answer is no, you cannot run PS5 games directly from an external SSD. You can store as many games on the external drive as it allows, but when you want to play them, you'll have to copy them to the PS5's internal storage first. Once the game files are copied, you can run the game.

### How many SSD slots does the PS5 have?

 There is one expansion SSD slot available inside the PS5\. You can also connect external SSDs using USB ports.
