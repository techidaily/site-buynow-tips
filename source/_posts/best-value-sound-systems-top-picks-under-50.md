##  What to Look For in a Budget Speaker in 2023

 Different people have different needs, so we've included a few different types of speakers on this list. You'll find bookshelf speakers, [Bluetooth speakers](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-photo-perfection-highest-rated-phone-tripods/), [soundbars](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-keep-the-conversation-flowing-on-discord/), [smart speakers](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-maximizing-revenue-with-youtubes-2024-partner-program/), and [subwoofers](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-non-functional-audio-devices-on-windows-7-systems/).

 The first thing you need to think about is what you're buying speakers for. Bookshelf speakers can be useful for music and movies, but a portable Bluetooth speaker doesn't work for a [home theater](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/aoc-unveils-powerhouse-triad-the-u3-graphic-pro-monitors-for-professionals/). Think about what you'll be using the speakers for the most and let this guide your decision.

 Many speakers these days are either battery-powered or use their own power supply that plugs into the wall. For these, all you require is any sort of audio signal, and you're ready to go. Bookshelf speakers, on the other hand, need an amplifier to reproduce sound.

 While most of the speakers we're looking at here are wireless, some like bookshelf speakers and subwoofers need cables. We'll make sure to mention the cables you'll need if they aren't included in the box.

 For Bluetooth and other wireless speakers, you also need to consider where you're using them. If you're mostly using a speaker inside your home, it doesn't need to be that tough. That said, if you're taking a speaker everywhere with you, make sure it has some protection from the elements.

 Finally, while we've included a single bespoke smart speaker, other speakers can include voice assistant support that lets them integrate with your smart home. If you value this functionality, make sure any speaker you're considering has it, as it's tough to add later on.

| Pros                          | Cons                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ✓ IP67 water resistance       | ✗ A speaker this small can only sound so big |
| ✓ 12-hour battery life        |                                              |
| ✓ You can pair two for stereo |                                              |

 The [Tribit StormBox Micro 2](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Portable-Speaker-Built/dp/B09Q59321N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) may be affordable and small, but it's a far more capable speaker than you'd imagine. This follow-up doesn't stray too far from the original, but improvements in sound make it better than ever.

 This is a speaker meant to go anywhere you do, so it's IP67-rated waterproof, which means you should be fine in the rain. The speaker also includes a built-in strap that you can use to attach it to handlebars on a bike or any other mounting point you prefer.

 Tribit promises up to 12 hours of playback time on the StormBox Micro 2, which is impressive, given the size. Even more impressive is that number seems like a cautious estimate. It seems that the speaker offers even more battery life in practice, as you can read in our sister site Review Geek's [Stormbox Micro 2 review](https://www.reviewgeek.com/135185/tribit-stormbox-micro-2-review/):

 The company's listed battery life for audio playback is 12 hours. To test this, I listened to multiple genres of music at a volume of 65%. After listening for eight and a half hours, the Tribit Stormbox Micro 2 still had 70% of the battery remaining. It's safe to say the 4700mAh / 3.6V battery will last for a day trip.

 Looking at photos of the StormBox Micro 2, it's difficult to imagine that it sounds very big. Thanks to some clever use of DSP, it sounds much bigger than it looks. That said, if you're looking for stereo, you'll need to pair two of these together, doubling the price.

 The standard finish of the Tribit StormBox Micro 2 is a [woven black](https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Portable-Speaker-Built/dp/B09Q59321N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). If you prefer more color in your speakers, a [blue version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGPCSM6Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is also available.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✓ 20 hour battery life at 50% volume | ✗ A little small for use as a home speaker |
| ✓ IPX5 water-resistant               |                                            |
| ✓ Capacitive touch panel is handy    |                                            |

 Bluetooth speakers typically endure rougher conditions than other speakers, so people don't always want to spend too much on one. The [DOSS Soundbox](https://www.amazon.com/DOSS-Wireless-Bluetooth-Portable-Speaker/dp/B01CQOV3YO?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a great affordable option, as not only does the speaker pack in all the features you need, but it's more rugged than many of its affordable colleagues.

 The Soundbox is IPX5 rated, which means that while it can't withstand immersion, it can handle jets and streams of water from any angle. If you're looking for a speaker to bring to the beach, the Soundbox is a great choice, assuming you don't toss it into the ocean.

 Instead of the usual buttons, the DOSS Soundbox uses a capacitive touch panel for its controls. This lets you pause and resume playback, adjust the volume, change tracks, and answer and end calls using the internal microphone. You can even use the speaker with Siri or Google Assistant.

 The Soundbox pumps out 12 watts per channel of stereo sound, and if you're listening at 50 percent volume, you'll get up to 20 hours of playtime. When it's time to top up the battery, you can recharge with the included cable in three to four hours.

 In addition to black, the DOSS Soundbox comes in [blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRPV4UK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [pink](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JN46X2M?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [red](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSTES8C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [white](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRPV94G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [yellow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K74QN7C?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [Tiffany Blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K76JMDG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) color options.

 When you think of a budget speaker, you're probably imagining that there will be some significant sacrifices regarding sound quality. That may be true in some speakers, but it isn't the case with the [ELAC Debut 2.0 B6.2](https://www.amazon.com/ELAC-Debut-Bookshelf-Speakers-Black/dp/B07B4Q5587?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 If you need some help decoding the name, it's referring to the fact that there is a pair of speakers, each powered by a 6.5-inch aramid fiber woofer, which has been redesigned for this model. A one-inch soft-dome tweeter accompanies this to carry the high frequencies.

 The cabinet is also slightly larger overall than the original model. This, combined with the forward-firing bass port, means that these can play frequencies down as low as 44 Hz without the help of a subwoofer.

 Unlike some of the other speakers we're looking at here, these speakers are passive, meaning you'll need either a receiver or [integrated amplifier](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveil-your-world-in-wide-angle-iosandroid-photo-integration-on-social-media/) to power them. They aren't the most sensitive speakers, so even though they're rated to handle up to 120 watts, they're not as loud as others in their class.

 Even though they're not as loud as they could be, they still have plenty of volume on tap to fill a small or medium-sized room with music. They work great for home theater, and ELAC offers them bundled with the [C5.2](https://www.amazon.com/ELAC-Debut-Bookshelf-Speakers-Black/dp/B07QVCPZW5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or [C6.2](https://www.amazon.com/ELAC-Debut-Bookshelf-Speakers-Black/dp/B07QVCPC7G?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) center channel speakers.

 Anker doesn't just make speakers, but all kinds of chargers, cables, and other accessories. That said, the company's Soundcore line of speakers has been popular for years now. While the company offers speakers from tiny to huge, our pick is the company's update on its original---the [Anker Soundcore 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTB55WH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 The Soundcore 2 pumps 12 watts of power into stereo neodymium drivers. On the Amazon listing, Anker says it uses advanced [DSP](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-the-world-of-zoom-audio-to-text-tools-for-2024/) to make for thumping bass without distortion. This is enhanced by a bass port using a patented spiral design to make for even more powerful lows.

 The Anker Soundcore 2 is the most waterproof speaker we're looking at, with an [IPX7-rated build](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). While these ratings are often provided by the manufacturer, not a third party, IPX7 means that the Soundcore 2 should be able to withstand immersion in up to one meter for up to 30 minutes without damage.

 Inside the Soundcore 2, Anker has packed a 5,200 mAh battery that the company says can provide up to 24 hours of non-stop music. Anker doesn't list the volume it used to get this figure, but if you're listening at moderate volumes, the battery should easily get you through even longer days.

 The Soundcore 2 is available in black, but those who prefer a more vibrant speaker can also choose from [blue](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074P2Z9B8?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), [red](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074NS9P2J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), and [teal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09944VF6S?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) options.

 Amazon's Echo Dot devices have always worked well as communication hubs, but early models weren't great as speakers. Fortunately, the sound keeps improving generation after generation, and the [Amazon Echo Dot With Clock (5th-gen)](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-release-clock-Smart-speaker/dp/B09B8W5FW7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) has also added some great new features.

 The look hasn't changed, which is effectively identical to the previous fourth-generation model. That isn't a problem here, since that model's redesign opened up space inside, making a less cramped design.

 This design allowed Amazon to add a larger audio driver, making this the best-sounding Echo Dot to date. You're not likely to get audiophile sound quality in this form factor, but if you're using this for background music as you get things done around the house, the quality is good.

 Aside from the updated article, the new Echo Dot also features a built-in thermometer, letting you easily check the temperature in different rooms. If you've got a [smart thermostat](https://win-forum.techidaily.com/top-four-social-networking-sites-facebook-twitter-instagram-and-youtube/), you can tie these together to control temperatures throughout your home more effectively.

 Most of the speakers we've looked at so far come from an approach where making music sound good is the primary goal. If you spend more time watching TV and movies than listening to music, a music-centric speaker doesn't really work best for you. Instead, consider a soundbar like the excellent [Bestisan BYL S9920](https://www.amazon.com/MEGACRA-Wireless-Soundbar-Adjustable-Mountable/dp/B07JM8729Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term).

 We're looking at the 40-inch, 100-watt version, which is the largest in the range. If you've got a smaller TV or just want a quieter speaker, Bestisan also makes this model in [28-inch](https://www.amazon.com/MEGACRA-Wireless-Soundbar-Adjustable-Mountable/dp/B07K1P13C7?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [34-inch](https://www.amazon.com/MEGACRA-Wireless-Soundbar-Adjustable-Mountable/dp/B07KM33VBG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) models, both with 80 watts of power. If your TV is larger, the 40-inch model will still be the best match.

 There are a few different ways to connect the S9920 to your TV. You can connect wirelessly with Bluetooth, assuming your TV supports it, but this can be problematic with lip-syncing at times. Your best bet is to connect with digital audio via the optical connector or analog audio over the RCA connectors.

 The Bestisan BYL S9920 doesn't come with a separate subwoofer or provide a connection for your own subwoofer. That said, the soundbar uses DSP for various sound modes like movies and movies. Adjustable bass and treble let you fine-tune the frequency response for your room.

 One neat touch that you often see in TVs but less so in soundbars is the dialog enhancer feature. This tunes the audio to let you hear voices, without turning up the soundbar so loud it bothers your neighbors.

 If you've already got a set of speakers you're happy with but feel like are missing out on the bass department, a subwoofer is a great option. These can get expensive quickly, but the [Monoprice 60-Watt Powered Subwoofer](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-108248-60-Watt-Powered-Subwoofer/dp/B009GUTJ34?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU206078&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F802939%2Fbest-budget-speaker%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) is a solid option at a solid price.

 This subwoofer features a frequency range from 50 Hz to 250 Hz, meaning the midrange and highs from your other speakers remain untouched. You can adjust the crossover frequency between 50 Hz and 150 Hz to avoid low subwoofer rumbles from voices and other elements you want to avoid hearing low frequencies from.

 I've personally used this subwoofer for several years, and it's a very set-and-forget product. Plug it in, set the volume, set the crossover frequency to match your other speakers, and that's about it. The subwoofer has an auto-on feature that means it will save power when not in use, then turn itself on when you begin using it.

 This is an active subwoofer, so any amp you're using doesn't need a separate powered subwoofer output. That doesn't mean it doesn't need a cable. Most amps and A/V receivers have a single RCA output for the subwoofer. This speaker has that connection but can also use left and right line-in or a speaker signal from your amp.

 The Monoprice 60-Watt Powered Subwoofer measures 13.75 × 11.75 × 11.75 inches, so while it isn't small, it's more compact than most subwoofers, which means you can easily find a space to stow it away.
