 What We Like

* Bottom doesn’t slide around
* Grey with a pattern—won’t show dirt
* Multiple uses—use it in an office, kitchen, etc.

 What We Don't Like

* No extra features
* Pricey for a basic mat

 While it is only a basic standing desk mat, the CumulusPRO provides solid foot comfort for a high price and a great deal of versatility.

 _We purchased the CumulusPRO Standing Desk Mat so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 Standing desks are no longer a luxury. With a variety of affordable options, it only makes sense there are more standing desk mats too, including ones like the CumulusPRO. Over the course of a week, we used it for a total of 20 hours. In our testing, we checked for comfort, durability, and whether the mat could be used in multiple different settings like an office, bedroom, study, or even a kitchen. We found it to be a basic and flexible standing mat that’s likely to be a good option for most people.

## **Design: Simply modern**

 At 24 inches by 36 inches (LW), the CumulusPRO is a very wide mat, providing ample space for us to move and shift around in. It’s also very modern looking, as the top of the mat has a simple grey, wavy design that would accommodate most modern office spaces. This particular mat was very thin, at 0.75 inches. It wasn’t as slick on the bottom as some other mats we tested, which we felt was a huge perk. And on top of that, the edges are designed to taper downward, so that you needn’t worry about tripping as you step onto it.

## **Comfort: A pleasant surprise**

 At first, we thought that we would tire easily on this mat. After all, it doesn’t come with the bells and whistles of some of the more expensive mat models out there. However, we were pleasantly surprised in that two hours of standing we weren’t fatigued. One of the reasons is because the mate is very cushy. Even though it’s thin, the moment we stepped onto it, our feet sunk into it. We also felt that the mat cradled our feet when we used it, which was a nice sensation.

In terms of versatility, the CumulusPRO mat is king.

 Another perk of this mat is that it’s very anti-dirt. Most of the other mats we’ve tested show the dirt coming off the bottom of our shoes. This mat, on the other hand, is designed to mask the dirt. By using this design, it’s also more versatile. You need a kitchen mat to ease your feet while cleaning up dinner? Or do you need a mat for your workers standing at a register? This mat can cover an array of tasks thanks to its simplicity.

 The bottom of the mat also isn’t slick, making it good for non-office settings, such as a kitchen. You can place it and don’t have to worry about it sliding under your feet. On the other hand, in an office setting, where you’re more likely to shift between standing and sitting for long periods, moving it can be irksome.

 Another nice feature of the CumulusPRO is that we could wear heels and not damage it.

 Another nice feature of the CumulusPRO is that we could wear heels and not damage it. While this may seem trivial, compared to other mats we tested, this was amazing for the ladies who like to wear heeled shoes.

## **Price: Pretty steep for a mat**

 At around $80 on Amazon, the CumulusPRO is expensive for a mat that doesn’t come with extra surface features. However, taking into context its versatility around the office and the home, the price is actually a solid investment. If you decide you don’t want it in your office, but say, in the kitchen, it can easily be transplanted into other areas of the house or workplace.

## **Ergodriven Topo vs. CumulusPRO Standing Desk Mat**

 We decided to compare the Ergodriven Topo against the CumulusPRO to see which we felt was the better bang for your buck. Price-wise, both the Topo and the CumulusPRO mats are similar in that the Topo retails for $100 while the CumulusPRO retails for around $80\. For a desk, the Topo mat we felt was superior to the CumulusPRO. The Ergodriven comes with basic wedges and a massage mound in the center to help alleviate foot pain during the day—features that the CumulusPRO doesn’t have.

 The Topo also cannot handle heels as easily as the CumulusPRO, as we discovered. However, in terms of versatility, the CumulusPRO mat is king. Because the mat comes without these features, it can be placed anywhere in a workspace or a home. If you’re looking for something more versatile, then the CumulusPRO mat is the ideal choice. However, if you want a true office mat, then the Ergodriven is the better option.

 Final Verdict

**Great for the basics.**

 For a basic mat, the CumulusPRO is a solid choice. We especially liked how it hides dirt and can be used for those who prefer to wear high heels. Considering it’s a basic standing mat, its versatility is definitely worth the investment.
