##  What to Look for in a Music Streaming Service in 2023

 Library size is the first consideration for most music lovers because the more songs from artists you like, the merrier. The featured music streaming services here feature more than 100 million songs each across different genres.

 A free trial is also key when looking into these services. With a free trial, you get ample time to explore entire libraries and get firsthand experience of different music streaming services. There's nothing worse than paying for a service that doesn't have the music or quality that you want.

 While some music streaming services offer a free tier with ads, premium ad-free music streaming attracts a monthly or annual fee, depending on your preference. Some platforms also offer family plans and special discounts.

 For audiophiles, bitrate is also important. Bitrate is the amount of audio/video data transferred per second. Usually, the higher the bitrate, the better the audio quality. The featured music streaming services below offer bitrates of up to 6,971Kbps.

 Downloads and offline streaming are also important for areas with poor reception and users concerned about data consumption. Most popular music streaming services offer this, but it's always good to double-check.

 Extras are the icing on the cake. Some of the featured streaming services support lossless audio (that doesn’t degrade with compression), music videos, podcasts, radio stations, live events, and skippable ads in the free tier, among others.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Free tier (Spotify Free) but with ads                              | Ads are not skippable on Spotify Free |

| Vast library of over 100 million songs at up to 320Kbps            |                                       |

 Claiming the top spot as the best overall music streaming service is [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/?)—a music streaming pioneer. Launched in 2008, Spotify is the largest music streaming platform. It offers decent audio bitrates of up to 320Kbps and also supports music videos.

 Spotify features 100 million+ songs, including classics and golden oldies, with audio formats including [AAC and Ogg/Vorbis](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-scaling-up-instagram-videos-mobile-and-desktop-approaches/). You can browse through Spotify’s playlists or even create your own custom playlists. Featured Charts and Viral Charts showcase the top trending songs globally, in the US, and by country.

 You can also explore top podcasts across different categories, such as business and technology, as well as lifestyle and health. You can even find live events around your location sold by Spotify or third parties.

 You can either use Spotify Free (with ads and limitations) or go premium. [Premium plans](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/) include Student ($5.99/mo), Duo ($14.99/mo), and Family ($16.99/mo) and support offline streaming, higher bitrates, a mobile-only AI-powered DJ/OAP, and other perks.

 Spotify is available pretty much everywhere you would listen to music, including Android, iOS, Windows, and even smart TVs and some smart home devices.

_Qobuz_

| Pros                                                  | Cons            |

 If you’re a die-hard audiophile who will do anything for high-fidelity sound, then you’ll probably love [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com), a leading lossless music platform. Qobuz also supports THX spatial audio for a more immersive 360-degree audio listening experience.

 Like Spotify, Qobuz was launched in 2008, but it has a relatively smaller user base. However, don’t let its relatively small user base fool you. Qobuz was the first to offer 16-bit CD-quality audio files for download and streaming, plus the first to stream 24-bit hi-res audio.

 Qobuz’s vast library features over 100 million songs, including more than 500,000 album reviews and artist bios. It is home to one of the largest collections of lossless CD and hi-res albums with a growing catalog of new additions. Qobuz features more specialized music genres than many of its competitors and supports offline streaming.

 You'll also have interactive articles, exclusive content, and expert-curated playlists to help you widen your musical knowledge—or you can create your own custom playlists.

 Qobuz is available in two packages, Studio and Sublime, each with solo, duo, and family plans. Studio comes with a 30-day free trial, then prices start from $10.83/mo. Sublime Solo and Duo cost $14.99/mo, while Sublime Family costs $17.99/mo after a 30-day free trial. Sublime subscribers can also enjoy up to 60 percent off Hi-Res purchases.

 Qobuz supports AIFF, ALAC, FLAC, WAV, and WMA lossless formats. It is available on Bluetooth/Wi-Fi devices with a speaker, such as smartphones, tablets, desktops and web players, cars, game consoles, smart TVs, smart home devices, and other audio equipment.

| Supports SD, HD, UHD (lossless) and spatial audio                 | No offline playback for single-device plan                             |

 Amazon is a household name in online retail. The retail giant also runs a music streaming service. Launched in 2016, this service is available in three categories: Amazon Music Free, Amazon Music Prime, and [Amazon Music Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2001124&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fthe-5-best-music-streaming-services%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) (AMU).

 A Prime membership is not required to use Amazon Music Free and Amazon Music Unlimited. However, the latter costs a bit more for non-Prime members. Additionally, Prime members can access Amazon Music Unlimited's 100 million plus songs—but only in shuffle mode.

 Songs are available in SD, HD, UHD (lossless), and spatial audio (mastered in Dolby Atmos and 360 Reality Audio), provided it's not the single-device plan. AMU offers curated playlists, ad-free music and podcasts, as well as music videos and radio stations. Amazon's Music Unlimited plan also supports offline streaming, unlimited skips (for the non-single-device plans), and Alexa.

 In addition, the music player has a cool animated lyric feature that makes listening and singing along much more fun. It definitely makes Amazon Music Unlimited a great choice to for setting up a karaoke night!

 In terms of audio formats, you'll get OPUS, FLAC, DD+JOC/EAC3-JOC, and MPEG-H (MHA1). Many of these aren't the typical MP3 and Lossless formats you're used to, but this won't be a dealbreaker if you're not an audiophile looking for a very specific format.

 You can try AMU for 90 days for free—though you can sometimes get an additional free month if you sign up around [Amazon Prime Day](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-motivate-and-master-your-movements-20-top-rated-workout-tracks/). Thereafter, you can settle for Single-Device ($4.99/mo), Student ($5.99/mo), Individual ($9.99/mo or $99/yr), or Family ($16.99/mo or $169/yr) plans.

 Amazon Music Unlimited is available for pretty much any device you'd play music from, including iOS, Android, smart home devices, smart TVs, and more. Make sure to double check that your device of choice can download AMU before diving in—more likely than not this streaming service will be supported.

 YouTube is one of the largest video streaming services around, with billions of monthly active users. The Google-owned platform also runs a music streaming service, known as [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/), which seamlessly integrates with YouTube.

 YouTube Music uses the same algorithm as YouTube, making it great at recommending tracks, albums, and artists. Supported music formats include FLAC, M4A, MP3, OGG, and WMA. However, similar to Spotify, it does not yet support lossless music—if this is a requirement for you, you'll want to look elsewhere.

 YouTube Music currently features more than 100 million songs. This includes official albums, singles, videos, remixes, live performances, and more across different genres. If you're unsure on what to listen to, the service also features several expert-curated playlists based on your preferences. These playlists also features New Releases, Charts, playlists by Moods and Genres, Trending Music, music videos, podcasts, radio stations, and so much more. Of course, you can create your own custom playlists, as well.

 YouTube Music Premium offers a 30-day free trial. Plans include Student ($5.49/mo), Individual ($10.99/mo), and Family ($16.99/mo), and all let you download music and listen to music ad-free, offline, and with your screen off. Even the free tier lets you skip [YouTube's increasingly annoying ads](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/systematic-revival-the-process-of-modernizing-windows-cards/).

 However, before you sign up for YouTube Music by itself, you can also bundle the service with [YouTube Premium](https://www.youtube.com/premium) for just $13.99 a month. This is only three dollars more than the individual plan, and if you're looking to subscribe to the music streaming service, having your benefits extend to YouTube videos is [well worth the cost](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/enhance-performance-with-a-hid-compliant-mouse-driver-update/).

 YouTube Music is available on Android, iOS, ChromeOS, Wear OS, watchOS, Google Nest, Sonos, Android TV, Android Auto, and via a web app.
