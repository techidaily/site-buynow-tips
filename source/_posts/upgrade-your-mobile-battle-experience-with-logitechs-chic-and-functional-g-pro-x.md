## Upgrade Your Mobile Battle Experience with Logitech's Chic and Functional G Pro X

Logitech just opened pre-orders for the Pro X 60, a stylish and ultra-compact gaming keyboard with a 1ms wireless response time. It's a compelling option for on-the-go gamers with a $180 keyboard budget.

 The [Logitech Pro X 60](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-keyboards/pro-x-60-wireless-keyboard.html?) features a compact, 60% layout, meaning that it lacks a numpad, arrow keys, and function row. While this isn't the best design for data entry or other professions, it's a highly portable and distraction-free option for gaming, especially if you use Logitech's KEYCONTROL system to create custom control layouts.

 The KEYCONTROL system is pretty robust. You can assign complex functions to individual keys, create intricate context-aware modifiers, or build up to 15 unique keyboard layout "layers." KEYCONTROL is easy to turn off, so you can always toggle to the default keyboard setup when necessary.

 Spec-wise, this looks to be an excellent gaming keyboard. It uses Logitech's GX Optical switches, high-quality double-shot PBT keycaps, and a 1ms response time via a 2.5Ghz wireless dongle (Bluetooth and USB connectivity are also supported). The keycaps are removable, you can customize the RGB lighting, and Logitech promises up to 65 hours of battery in wireless mode.

 And, despite its ultra-compact design, the Pro X 60 features a volume rocker and media controls on the side of its chassis. A game-mode switcher is also located at the top-left corner of the keyboard.

 There's just one drawbackâ€”the GX Optical switches are not hot-swappable. You choose between linear and tactical switches, and that's what you get. Both the linear and tactical GX Optical switches have a non-adjustable actuation point at 1.5mm, so they should feel "fast" and "fluid."

 If necessary, you can connect the Pro X 60 to three different devices over Bluetooth. Just know that this is a common feature in Logitech keyboards, and similar functionality is offered by competing brands.

 You can [pre-order the Logitech Pro X 60](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-keyboards/pro-x-60-wireless-keyboard.html?) for $180\. Orders begin shipping April 16th. The keyboard comes in black, magenta, and white colorways with GX Optical tactile or linear switches. A two-year hardware warranty, six-foot USB-A to USB-C cable, carrying case, and Logitech G keycap are included with your purchase.
