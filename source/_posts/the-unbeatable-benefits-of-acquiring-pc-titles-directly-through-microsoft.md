## The Unbeatable Benefits of Acquiring PC Titles Directly Through Microsoft

### Key Takeaways

* Xbox Play Anywhere lets you play digital games on both PC and Xbox with progress syncing.
* You only need to buy the game from the Microsoft Store once, but not all games are compatible with Play Anywhere; check the official website for a full list.
* Consider buying games from the Microsoft Store for Play Anywhere benefits, but know that some games may lack mod support and cross-platform multiplayer.

 One big advantage of PC gaming is the ability to play all your games on a single device. As a PC gamer, you probably think there's hardly any reason to turn on your Xbox at all, right? Well, Xbox Play Anywhere presents a compelling argument to the contrary.

##  Xbox Play Anywhere Lets You Play on PC or Xbox

 Play Anywhere is a long-standing initiative in the Xbox ecosystem. When you purchase a compatible Xbox Play Anywhere digital game, you can play it on Xbox _and_ on a Windows PC at no additional cost. While Play Anywhere is not prominently promoted by Xbox, it is still a supported feature compatible with some notable new releases such as 2024's _Persona 3 Reload._

 When you purchase an Xbox Play Anywhere game from the Microsoft Store, either on your Xbox console or through the [Microsoft Store website](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-make-snapchat-memories-shine-2-lens-creation-methods/), you can play it on your Windows 10 or 11 PC simply by logging into the [Xbox App](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc) with the same Microsoft account you used to purchase the game. Naturally, the game will also be playable on the corresponding Xbox console by logging into the same Microsoft account.

 A key feature of Play Anywhere is that your progress goes with you. Wherever you log into your Microsoft account, you will find all your saves, game add-ons, and achievements for all Xbox Play Anywhere games you own.

 There are many reasons to be [both a console and PC gamer](https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/full-restoration-of-your-iphone-master-the-reset-process-with-stellar-across-windowsmac/). If you find yourself going back and forth between your Xbox and PC, it can be worth your while to buy supported Play Anywhere games from Microsoft rather than from PC-focused storefronts like Steam or Epic Games.

##  Not All Games Support Play Anywhere

 While Play Anywhere can be a great value proposition for the hybrid gamer, it is important to note that not all games are compatible with this service. The [official Play Anywhere website](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere) provides a full list of compatible games.

 On the plus side, all first-party Microsoft games are compatible with Play Anywhere. This includes games like _Starfield_, _Sea of Thieves_, and _Hi-Fi Rush_. Many other big-name titles are also available, like _Resident Evil 2_. You can even find some great indie games on Play Anywhere, like _Hades_ and _Hollow Knight_.

 The Xbox Play Anywhere program fails to include some notable must-have titles, though. For example, some of 2023's biggest hits like _Hogwarts Legacy_, _Diablo IV_, and _Star Wars Jedi: Survivor_ remain conspicuously absent from the list of supported games. It is also extremely important to be aware that [choosing to buy the physical version](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximizing-b-roll-creative-uses-and-integration/) of an Xbox game will not allow you to play it on PC, even if the digital version of the game supports Play Anywhere.

##  How the Microsoft Store Compares to Steam and Others

 Play Anywhere is a great point in favor of any games that support it, but it does require purchasing the games from the Microsoft Store to take advantage of the feature. This may or may not be a dealbreaker, depending on your preferences. While some users have no complaints regarding the Microsoft Store, others report slow performance while browsing and claim that the algorithm recommends uninteresting games or apps.

 If you're interested in [modding your PC games](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-a-locked-tecno-spark-10-4g-phone-by-drfone-android/), be aware that buying through the Microsoft Store can complicate the process. The Microsoft Store version of many games use a locked folder that modders cannot access, or they may lack key dependencies that certain mods rely on.

 Multiplayer is another factor to consider. Some Play Anywhere games, like _Sea of Thieves_ for example, have full [cross-platform multiplayer](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/overcoming-laptop-navigation-hurdles-how-to-unfreeze-and-restore-mouse-functionality/). This means that you can play with friends no matter what platform they are on, be it Xbox, Steam, or anywhere else. Others, like _Mortal Kombat 11_, lack this functionality and might not enable you to play with friends on the Steam version of the game if you are playing the Microsoft Store version.

 Some people prefer gaming on a console, while plenty of others love doing all their gaming on a PC. If you straddle the line, it can be difficult to decide which platform you should choose when buying new games. [There's still a place for consoles](https://common-error.techidaily.com/resolving-copy-paste-problems-in-windows-11-a-comprehensive-guide/) in the gaming industry, and great features like Xbox Play Anywhere will keep many gamers coming back to the Microsoft Store.
