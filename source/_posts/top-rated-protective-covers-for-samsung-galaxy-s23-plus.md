##  What to Look For in a Galaxy S23+ Case in 2024

 Like many high-end Android phones, the [Galaxy S23+](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones%2Fgalaxy-s23-ultra%2F) has glass on the back and the front. Even with this high-quality, durable glass, the phone is susceptible to damage all over. If you want to keep your S23+ safe, you'll need a case.

 One of the most important decisions to make regarding a case is the form factor you want to use. This goes hand in hand with how much protection the case offers. Slim and light cases don't add as much bulk and fit in your pocket easily but have less protection, while cases that offer more protection are significantly bulkier.

 You'll also want to consider what extra features you want the case to have. For example, even slim cases can have raised edges to better protect your screen and camera lens, while wallet-style cases offer you slots to hold cards and pockets for cash.

 Cases come in different materials as well. Some use a more rigid plastic composite, while others use [thermoplastic polyurethane](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/), or TPU. TPU is softer and more flexible than rigid materials but is easier to fit onto your phone. You'll also see cases in leather, faux leather, or combinations of materials.

 Many cases offer support for [wireless charging](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-free-yourself-from-cash-for-sound-the-best-18-audio-crackers-on-youtube/), but it's important to note that not all phones do. If you're looking at a case, and it doesn't mention that it features [support for wireless charging](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-learn-how-to-change-number-on-tiktok-with-working-methods/), don't assume that it will work with wireless chargers.

 Finally, the look is a significant factor. Even plastic cases come in various colors and clear finishes let you see your phone underneath. No matter how protective your case is, if you don't like how it looks, you're not going to use it.

 The cases below will only fit the Galaxy S23+ model. They will not fit on the standard S23 or Ultra.

| Pros                                                 | Cons                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ✓ Slim fit but good protection                       | ✗ Limited to black and green color options |
| ✓ Anti-slip design and matte finish                  |                                            |
| ✓ Air Cushion Technology offers good drop protection |                                            |

 Most people don't need heavy-duty protection for their phones. You just need something to protect it from the occasional drop or bump. The [Spigen Liquid Air](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Galaxy-Plus/dp/B0BJSLLBVT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has plenty of protection for most people, with a slim, easy-to-hold grip.

 This case features an anti-slip design and matte finish that should help you hold onto it. It also features raised bezels above the screen and cameras, protecting both in the event of a drop or just placing your phone on a rough surface.

 While it isn't mentioned on the Amazon page, Spigen mentions that most models of its cases, including the Liquid Air series, are compatible with wireless charging. This is to be expected with a phone with this type of form factor, but it's still nice to see it confirmed.

 The Spigen Liquid Air Designed for Galaxy S23+ Case uses the company's Air Cushion Technology for anti-shock protection. The case is available in [Matte Black](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Galaxy-Plus/dp/B0BJSLLBVT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Abyss Green](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Designed-Galaxy-Plus/dp/B0BJSLLBVT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 You can spend quite a bit of money on a case for your phone if you want, but you certainly don't have to. The [Caseology Parallax Case](https://www.amazon.com/Caseology-Parallax-Designed-Samsung-Military/dp/B0BHF8PWR3?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is affordable and doesn't make any compromises when protecting your phone.

 The back of the case uses Caseology's Hexa Cube design, which has an eye-catching look but also gives your fingertips something to hold onto on the back of the phone. This, combined with TPU grips on the sides, means you'll always have a secure grip on your Galaxy S23+

 While Caseology says the Parallax case uses military-grade protection, that doesn't mean it's bulky or overly large. The case is compatible with wireless charging and offers space to work with tempered glass screen protectors like this [Samcorn model for the Galaxy S23+](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Plus-Fingerprint/dp/B0BS5CQ18N?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Made from a blend of Polycarbonate and [TPU](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-steamvr-issues-in-minutes-with-this-simple-guide/), this wallet case has a smooth finish and a simple elegance about it. Samsung describes this wallet-style case as environmentally conscious, as it uses post-consumer recycled plastic in its makeup. It may be a long way off from being 100% recycled, but it takes some decent strides in the right direction. 

 The main feature of this case is its interactive display window, situated in the top right corner of the cover. This handy window allows you to check the time, answer calls, or pause your music without having to open up the cover. By granting you access to this more basic functionality, it allows you to keep the rest of your phone screen protected and free from oily fingerprints. 

 The S-View Wallet doesn't rank amongst the more feature-rich 23+ cases, but if you're looking for a stylish and more minimalist wallet case, then this will do the job nicely.

 If you're regularly bringing your Galaxy S23+ to rough locales, a normal case isn't going to protect it. The [UAG Plasma Case](https://www.amazon.com/URBAN-ARMOR-GEAR-Designed-Samsung/dp/B0BSF9C7SW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) will protect your phone in all but the harshest environments.

 Urban Armor Gear takes its cases seriously, testing this model with 16-foot drop tests. To reduce impacts on corners, the case corners are reinforced with TPU. The edges of the case are textured with a tactile grip to hopefully prevent you from dropping the phone in the first place.

 Raised bezels around the screen and cameras protect the glass in these important areas. Wireless charging is supported, with Urban Armor Gear stating that most third-party chargers will work with the case.

 There are plenty of clear cases out there, but many are bulky, don't offer much protection, or have other shortcomings. The [Spigen Liquid Crystal Case](https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Liquid-Crystal-Designed-Galaxy/dp/B0BJSG2XJV?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has everything you want in a clear case, with a few interesting touches.

 The Spigen Liquid Crystal series of cases are made from a single, flexible TPU layer. This offers decent protection, but also makes placing the case on your phone and removing it easier than cases that use a rigid element to reinforce the case body.

 This case is compatible with wireless charging in more ways than one. Not only can you charge your phone wirelessly with this case, but it also supports [Samsung PowerShare wireless charging](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tweetvidtowebm-easy-streaming-tools-for-2024/).

 Finding a thin case for your phone can be tough. You don't want much extra bulk, but you still want to ensure that your phone is adequately protected. The [TORRAS Shockproof Case](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-Shockproof-Designed-Translucent-Protective/dp/B0BMLLF6GG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is sleek and slim but has plenty of features to keep your phone safe.

 TORRAS says this case has been tested with over 8,000 drops from 10 feet. This is thanks in part to the 360-degree honeycomb airbag design that surrounds the outside of the case. The case also uses TORRAS's patented X-shock design to reinforce the corners against impacts.

 As with many other cases we're looking at, the TORRAS model features raised bezels for extra protection around the screen and camera lenses. It also features nano-coating to prevent fingerprints and soft silicone edges for a better grip.

 The TORRAS Shockproof Designed for Samsung Galaxy S23+ Case is available in two colors---[Black](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-Shockproof-Designed-Translucent-Protective/dp/B0BMLLF6GG?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [Blue](https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-Shockproof-Designed-Translucent-Protective/dp/B0BMLN7373?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU202691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F871970%2Fbest-samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce).

 Snakehive Vintage Wallet cases are handmade in Europe, using [European Nubuck](https://bestleather.org/types-of-leather/nubuck/) leather.

 Looking at the wallet functions, you get three card slots and a money compartment. The case also uses a magnetic closure to ensure that your phone, cards, and money stay safe. Raised bezels protect the screen and camera lens.
