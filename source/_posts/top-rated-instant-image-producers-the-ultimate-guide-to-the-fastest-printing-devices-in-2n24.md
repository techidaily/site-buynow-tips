##  What to Look for in an Instant Photo Printer

 The best instant photo printers should be compact, lightweight, and portable, so you can take them anywhere. While 4x6-inch printers are bigger than 2x3-inch ones, they’re still easy to carry in your tote bag or car. Other printers, such as [3D printers](https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-move-contacts-from-oppo-f23-5g-to-iphone-131415-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/), are much larger and more complicated to use.

 Speaking of use, the best instant photo printers are usually easy to set up and use. Also, think about how big you'll want your photos to be. Instant photos typically range from 2x3 to 4x6 inches, so choose a printer that matches your preferred size. The size is usually mentioned in the product name.

 Printing technology is also key. Many modern instant photo printers use zero ink technology (ZINK), which doesn’t require ink, toner, or cartridges. Instead, they use special printing papers embedded with colors. These papers often have a sticky back and are resistant to tears, smudges, and water.

 The best instant photo printers work with iOS and Android devices; some even support PCs. They can connect via Bluetooth, USB, or hotspot. All featured printers have intuitive apps that let you edit and personalize your photos before printing.

 Printing speed is equally important if you want to print lots of photos quickly. The best instant photo printers can print a photo in under a minute. With a powerful rechargeable battery, some printers, like the HP Sprocket 2x3-inch Printer, can print up to 35 photos on a single charge.

 Instant photo printers often come with some printing paper, but you’ll need to buy more once you run out. You can easily find these special papers from the printer’s manufacturer or other vendors.
