##  What to Look for in a Smartphone Gimbal

 Make sure the gimbal supports your phone model. While all the gimbals we feature support Android and iOS phones, not all phones will be compatible with every gimbal. Check the compatibility list for each gimbal to be sure.

 Look for a gimbal that’s easy to carry around. All the gimbals we feature are foldable and portable, with some even small enough to fit in your jeans pocket. This means you can take them anywhere without lugging around bulky equipment.

 A good gimbal should be simple to set up and operate. The ones we recommend come with detailed instructions or prompts to help you get started quickly. Pay attention to features like intuitive apps, buttons, screens, and controls that make the gimbal easy to maneuver.

 Since you might be using the gimbal for extended periods, choosing one with a comfortable, ergonomic handle is important. Some gimbals, like the Insta360 Flow gimbals, can double as a tripod and a selfie stick, while others come with separate tripod attachments.

 All the gimbals we feature support 3-axis stabilization, which means they can rotate through different angles (pan, tilt, and roll) to capture every moment smoothly.

 AI tracking is a great feature that keeps your subject in focus, even when it's moving. This allows the gimbal to follow the subject automatically, ensuring smooth and focused shots. All the gimbals we recommend include AI tracking.

![Insta360 Flow Pro Gimbal on gradient background](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/insta360-flow-pro.jpg) 

| Pros                                                      | Cons                  |

 The [Insta360 Flow Pro Gimbal](https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-Flow-Pro-Stabilization-Built/dp/B0D6QPW32F/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004354&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smartphone-gimbals%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of our top picks for smartphone gimbals. Straight out of the box, you'll notice its high-quality build and how compact it is when folded—it fits easily in your bag or pocket, making it perfect for travel. It's also super easy to set up and use. There are detailed tutorials that clearly explain all its features, making it simple to follow whether you're new to gimbals or a seasoned user.

 The 360 Flow Pro includes a strong magnetic phone clamp that securely holds your phone, even with lots of movement. There's also an optional [MagSafe-](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/mastering-regional-adjustments-how-to-update-regions-on-your-iphone/)compatible mount. Once you attach your phone, the gimbal automatically powers on and balances it with its Rapid Deploy system. If you've struggled with balancing a gimbal before, you'll appreciate how quickly you can start shooting. It even comes with a grip cover.

 With its built-in tripod and selfie stick, you can easily turn the handle into a tripod for solo shooting or extend it as a selfie stick. The Insta360 Flow Pro and its predecessor, the [Insta360 Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-Flow-AI-Powered-Stabilization-Built/dp/B0BZWK9JFK/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004354&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smartphone-gimbals%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), are the only gimbals with these features (plus 360 panorama shots). It also has a cold shoe mount and a [power bank to charge your phone on the go](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/two-ways-to-track-my-boyfriends-zte-nubia-z60-ultra-without-him-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), saving you from buying extra accessories.

 Its One-Tap Pairing feature saves you time by letting you pair your iPhone to the gimbal just once and then connect quickly with [NFC](https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-speaker-malfunctions-in-microsoft-presentations/) and Apple DockKit, an industry first. With One-Tap Pairing and Rapid Deploy, you can easily capture spontaneous moments. The touch controls are intuitive and centrally located, allowing you to switch between landscape and portrait modes or between the back and selfie cameras effortlessly.

 The Insta360 Flow Pro offers 3-axis stabilization (pan, tilt, and roll), ensuring you capture every moment smoothly. Its advanced AI, Deep Track 3.0, allows you to easily track people and animals, keeping them in frame even in crowded places, and lets you edit your footage. Finally, it's compatible with a large range of phones—but be sure to double-check that your device is on the list.

| Excellent subject tracking with ActiveTrack 6.0    |                                                    |
| 3-axis stabilization for cinematic quality footage |                                                    |

 If you're a casual videographer or a budding vlogger looking for a budget-friendly yet reliable smartphone gimbal, we highly recommend the [DJI Osmo Mobile SE Intelligent Gimbal](https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Stabilizer-Magnetic-Portable-Foldable/dp/B0B7XCG225/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004354&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-smartphone-gimbals%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). It's our top pick for the best budget smartphone gimbal because it's cheaper than the Insta360 Flow Pro but doesn't skimp on quality. It can almost go toe-to-toe with the Flow Pro.

 Though slightly larger than the 360 Flow Pro, the DJI Osmo Mobile SE is still compact and foldable, making it easy to carry whether hiking or exploring your city. If you encounter something interesting, its quick-release magnetic clamp lets you attach and detach your phone instantly. Plus, the ergonomic, stain-resistant, and anti-slip handle makes it comfortable to hold with one hand, even for long filming sessions.

 While it doesn't have a built-in tripod like the Insta360 Flow Pro, the DJI Osmo Mobile SE includes a detachable tripod grip. This is a great feature for recording yourself or taking better selfies. Pairing your phone with the gimbal via Bluetooth is easy, and the intuitive DJI Mimo app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dji-mimo/id1431720653), [Android](https://www.dji.com/global/mimo)) provides clear instructions to help you get started.

 The DJI Osmo Mobile SE features easy-to-use controls that let you switch between landscape and portrait modes for versatile shooting. By installing the DJI Mimo app, you can even use your [Apple Watch](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-ae-design-best-free-templates-for-professionals/) as a remote control, allowing you to view camera feeds, adjust the gimbal’s angles, and capture footage all from your watch.

 The DJI Osmo Mobile SE supports 3-axis stabilization with a powerful algorithm that compensates for shakes and vibrations in real time, ensuring smooth, professional-looking footage every time. We also love the Active Track 6.0 AI tracking feature, which locks onto and tracks moving people or animals, keeping them focused and centered in the frame. It's compatible with most iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and Huawei phones.
