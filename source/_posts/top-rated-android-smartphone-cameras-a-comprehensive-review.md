##  What to Look For in an Android Camera Phone in 2024

 If you're looking for an Android smartphone with a great camera, there are a lot of factors to consider when making the purchase. Many companies try to distract customers with gimmicky features and specs that look good on paper, but they don't tell the full story.

 Take [megapixels](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), for example. While they can increase the resolution of your photos, unless features like [post-processing](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/ultimate-selection-best-video-calling-tools-phonepc-for-2024/) and color reproduction are good, you'll wonder what went wrong with the unimpressive image or video you just captured.

 Companies like Google have taken the software route with their cameras. The search giant's smartphone line relies on advanced algorithms to produce flagship-quality photographs, and Pixel phones are well-known for their high-quality pictures.

 On the other hand, the actual camera hardware is also important. You can have the best smartphone camera software on the market, but if the sensor isn't capable enough, you'll hit the ceiling in terms of versatility and quality sooner than you might expect.

 With so many different ways to implement a smartphone camera, it's our job to break them all down and highlight the best ones. Below, we've listed a handful of phones that excel in their respective categories and offer the best balance of hardware and software.

##  Best Android Camera Phone Overall: [Google Pixel 8 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F8%5Fpro?hl=en-US) 

![Fingerprint smudges on the Google Pixel 8 Pro camera bump](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/fingerprint-smudges-on-the-google-pixel-8-pro-camera-bump-1.jpg)

| Pros                                    | Cons                  |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Great camera                            | Mediocre battery life |
| Vibrant display                         | Expensive             |
| Google AI helps with a variety of tasks |                       |
| Google Tensor G3                        |                       |

 The latest flagship from Google, the [Pixel 8 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F8%5Fpro?hl=en-US), gets just about everything right. It's a bit pricey and doesn't have the best battery life, but if you're seeking an Android smartphone with a high-end camera, the Pixel 8 Pro is a great fit.

 Its triple-camera system includes a wide lens, ultrawide lens, and telephoto lens, allowing you to capture all sorts of images. And thanks to a massive 6.7-inch display with up to 2400 nits of brightness, you can see exactly what you're capturing before snapping your shot. The display also benefits from a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes operating the phone buttery smooth whether you're shooting photos or scrolling through the news.

 Other standout features include Google AI that helps optimize your photos, the fast Tensor G3 chip, and a sleek design that'll make you want to walk around without a case. It's quite expensive, starting at $999, but no doubt it's a great all-around camera phone for Android users.

##  Best Budget Android Camera Phone: [Google Pixel 7a](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

Justin Duino / How-To Geek

| Pros                                    | Cons                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Fantastic camera for the price          | $50 more expensive than the previous model |
| Excellent performance                   | Cheap-feeling build quality                |
| Upgraded display with 90Hz refresh rate |                                            |

 In previous years, the A-series Pixel phones from Google were essentially the runner-up, as the Pixel 6a was to the Pixel 6\. That has changed rather dramatically with the latest versions of these phones. If your main interest is the camera, the [Google Pixel 7a](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-secrets-to-parallel-playback-prowess-for-2024/) might even be a better buy than the standard Pixel 7.

 On the rear, the Pixel 7a features a 64MP, f/1.89 wide lens and a 13MP, f/2.2 ultra-wide lens. While the Pixel 7 has a larger sensor, which could theoretically allow for better image capture, the megapixel counts are smaller at 50MP and 12MP, respectively. The ultra-wide lens is also a wider angle on the 7a.

 Similarly, while the front lens is 13MP, f/2.2 on the Pixel 7a, it's 10.8MP, f/2.2 on the Pixel 7\. While previously, the A-series phones shared the same processor as the main numbered series, the processors were slightly worse spec-wise. That's no longer the case, with the Pixel 7 and 7a sharing a Google Tensor G2 chipset and 8GB RAM.

 The Pixel 6a was stuck with a 60Hz refresh rate, while the 6 featured a smoother 90Hz refresh rate. While the Pixel 7a's 6.1-inch screen is smaller than the 6.3-inch screen found on the 7, both now support 90Hz refresh rates, though the Pixel 7a is set to 60Hz by default.

 Unlike the Pixel 7, which is available with 128GB or 256GB of storage, the 7a is limited to 128GB. The Google Pixel 7a is available in [Charcoal](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9XNBRB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Sea](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9T8R41?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Snow](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-7a-Unlocked-Android/dp/B0BZ9R47PC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color varieties.

 Unlike an iPhone, it's difficult to determine which Android phone is undeniably the best camera phone on the market. While it faces stiff competition from Google's Pixel series, the [Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Titanium/dp/B0CMDMKQB7/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is in contention for the title of best of the best, thanks in no small part to the quality of its cameras.

 Looking at the camera lenses, the S24 Ultra features four on the back, starting with the main 200MP, f/1.7 aperture lens, with a 1/1.3-inch sensor OIS. This is complemented by the 50MP f/3.4 telephoto and 10MP f/2.4 telephoto lenses, both of which feature OIS, and a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide lens. You also get a 12MP f/2.2 front-facing camera for a total of five different cameras.

 The lenses and sensors are important, but the camera software is just as important. Samsung has mastered this for years, and the night photography features are proof. The S24 Ultra also features AI camera features, letting you easily erase objects from an image or completely replace the sky.

 Of course, it's not all about the cameras here. The 6.8-inch dynamic AMOLED screen is also fantastic, with a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 3088 x 1440 pixels making for a pixel density of 501ppi. This features HDR support, and is protected by scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass.

Best Premium Android Camera Phone

#####  Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra

The new Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's high-end flagship phone. It features a titanium frame, a flat display with Gorilla Glass armor, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC powering new Galaxy AI features.

| Pros                                 | Cons                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Great price                          | Display isn't as vibrant as Pixel 8 Pro |
| Impressive camera                    | Average battery life                    |
| Sleek design                         |                                         |
| Captures great pictures in low-light |                                         |

 The [Google Pixel 8](http://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F8?hl=en-US) shares a lot of the same DNA as the Pixel 8 Pro, so it should come as no surprise that it's a great camera phone. It lacks a telephoto lens, but it keeps the Tensor G3 chip and 120Hz display while also shedding a few bucks from its price tag.

 The main 50 MP camera is 21% more light-sensitive than the outgoing Pixel 7, allowing you to capture incredible images even when the sun goes down. Google also managed to make autofocus work faster in low-light settings than before—so you won't be sitting around for several seconds as it tries to process what it's seeing.

 You'll also benefit from a 6.2-inch display that makes the phone more portable than its larger sibling, even if it's not quite as vibrant as the 6.7-inch display of the Pixel 8 Pro. You'll also likely need to plug the phone in every night, as most people will only get just about a full day of use before needing a recharge. Beyond those small caveats, however, the Pixel 8 is a great Android camera phone at a great price.

| Pros                                  | Cons                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✓ Both cameras take great photos      | ✗ Software can be on the complex side |
| ✓ Fantastic display                   |                                       |
| ✓ Sleek-looking design                |                                       |
| ✓ Samsung promises 7 years of updates |                                       |

 As the portrait modes on many flagship phones will show, a great photo is every bit as much about software processing as it is about the actual lens and camera sensor. While Google Pixel phones are known for great photo processing, the [Samsung Galaxy S24](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDKX76Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is still the phone to beat when it comes to selfies.

 It may not have the impressive five lenses of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the S24 still impresses in the camera department. The rear features a 50MP f/1.8 main wide lens and 10 MP f/2.4 telephoto lens, both of which feature OIS, plus a 12 MP f/2.2 ultrawide lens. The front-facing selfie camera uses a 12 MP f/2.2 lens, backed by Samsung's powerful processing.

 As for actually viewing your photos, the S24 features a 6.2-inch dynamic AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support. The 1080 x 2340 display isn't as sharp as the S24 Ultra, but with a pixel density of around 416ppi, it's still plenty sharp.

 The phone gets its processing power from the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SM8650-AB chipset and Adreno 750 as the S24 Ultra. This, combined with the 8GB RAM, powers the software processing that help make the photos this phone can take so impressive. All of this is powered by a 4,000mAh battery, making for excellent battery life.

 The Samsung Galaxy S24 is available with 128GB or 256GB storage, and comes in [Amber Yellow](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDKX76Q/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Cobalt Violet](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDRFVTL/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), [Marble Gray](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDLJR6K/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), and [Onyx Black](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Processor/dp/B0CMDTFNGM/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU209196&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F745216%2Fbest-android-camera-phones%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) color varieties.

The Xperia 1 V on a stylized background.

| Pros                                 | Cons                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Tons of camera customization options | Incredibly expensive         |
| Premium design and materials         | Not as popular as its rivals |
| Headphone jack                       |                              |

 It may not be as well-known as other smartphones, but the [Xperia 1 V](https://electronics.sony.com/mobile/smartphone/all/p/xqdq62-b) is an impressive device. Along with a sleek design, you'll find a list of premium features, including the ability to record 4K video.

 Filming in 4K is just the start, as the Xperia 1 V also benefits from great low-light footage capture, enhanced AI for improved image quality, and cinematic color expression with its [S-Cinetone](https://sonycine.com/faqs/what-is--s-cinetone-/) technology. Other useful features include built-in live streaming, Videography Pro for tons of customization options, and a gorgeous OLED display that makes it easy to see what you're filming.

 Aside from its filming chops, Sony packed the Xperia 1 V with tons of other great hardware. Inside you'll find a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Mobile processor for blazing-fast interactions, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus for a durable display, and support for 5G networks.

 All these features don't come cheap, with the smartphone clocking in at a staggering $1,400\. That makes it more expensive than popular models from Google and Samsung. But if you're after a high-quality suite of cameras that are great at recording video, it deserves a closer look.
