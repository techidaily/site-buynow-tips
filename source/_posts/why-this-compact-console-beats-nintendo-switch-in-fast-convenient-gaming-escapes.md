## Why This Compact Console Beats Nintendo Switch in Fast, Convenient Gaming Escapes

### Key Takeaways

* Playdate is a charming, eye-catching handheld with a unique design and game distribution model.
* The handheld console offers quick and satisfying gaming experiences perfect for short play sessions.
* The trademark crank feature sets the Playdate apart, offering transformative gameplay experiences.

 When I want to untether my long gaming sessions from a TV, it's hard to resist my Nintendo Switch. However, when I need a quick fix at home, the handheld I'm reaching for most often is one you might not have heard of: the Playdate.

##  What Is a Playdate?

 Playdate is a nifty handheld released in 2022 by Panic Inc (the publisher of _Untitled Goose Game_ and _Firewatch_). Its defining features are the crank-based control input and a hyper-sharp one-bit screen. It harkens back to the days of non-backlit Game Boys both in form factor and spirit, but with a fidelity those systems didn't offer. It's also become a haven for independent developers looking for a low-stakes environment to explore unique game design concepts, as well as upstarts who use its web-based game builder, Pulp.

 Playdate is also noteworthy for its game distribution model. Every console comes with 24 games, doled out at a pace of two per week. These span the gamut of game genres, from puzzlers to RPGs to high-score chasers. Some were created by famous developers such as Bennett Foddy and Zack Gage exclusively for Playdate. Options beyond this "season one" collection include Panic's curated catalogue of games for purchase—the highest profile of which being Lucas Pope's _Mars After Midnight_—and [sideloading games](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-nuance-the-human-advantage-over-bots/) following support through [the Playdate website](https://help.play.date/games/sideloading/).

##  This Charming Device Invites You to Play

 It's hard not to notice a Playdate when one's in your eyeline, as the striking yellow casing (or an equally colorful protective case) pops off any desk. It's such an visual draw that some people even use it as a clock, a use-case for which Panic has announced [a forthcoming dock](https://play.date/stereo-dock/). But more importantly, the Playdate screams "carefree fun" before you even pick it up, which in turn entices you to play with it.

 The charm only increases after unlocking the device, a whimsical process itself that involves pressing the lock button twice, each click opening a sleeping eye displayed on the screen. Just like that, the Playdate comes alive in your hands. From here, you're greeted with your library of games, sleekly presented as a series of animated cards. Scrolling through this photogenic menu with the side-hitched crank is enjoyable in-and-of itself, especially compared to the simplistic utilitarian menu of the Switch. In other words, the Playdate makes sure you're having fun before you're having fun, but doesn't complicate the experience in doing so.

 It's also noteworthy that unlike the bright screens we often spend much of our day starting at, the Playdate's screen isn't backlit. It's akin to reading on an [e-ink Kindle](https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-the-key-to-captivating-audiences-crafting-fb-slideshows/), except you get to game instead. Thus, a quick Playdate session becomes a respite for the eyes.

##  The Games Are Satisfying in Quick Bursts

 Of course, what matters most are the games. Whereas most Switch titles are console-ready experiences that ask for prolonged attention, many of Playdate's best games are built to provide substantive gameplay in bite-sized sessions. This could be minigames like _Whitewater Wipeout_ and _Root Bear_, which require deft manipulation of the crank to net high scores, or roguelikes like _Under the Castle_, where a quick dungeon run contributes to broader progression. Because developers approach Playdate with this quick-hit design philosophy in mind, the hardware and software harmoniously synchronize when used in this manner.

 Even narrative games can thrive with short play sessions in mind. For example, _Bloom_ tells its narrative through text message conversations between characters that update a few times per day ,alongside a light farming simulator that you manage with a similar frequency. While on most gaming hardware an experimental concept like this might feel laborious and undercooked, it flourishes on an always-on handheld like Playdate that is laser-focused on enabling this format of play.

 You'd be right in thinking that [smartphones are also capable of this](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-iphone-8-data-from-ios-icloud-drfone-by-drfone-ios-data-recovery-ios-data-recovery/). However, Playdate doesn't come burdened with outside distractions that aim to pull you away, like texting, push notifications, and so forth. Meanwhile, although the Switch lets you stay focused on games, it's not as easy to jump out of larger games into a smaller one if you just want a bit of light fun.

 Also worth noting is that you can easily both sideload and buy games through your computer's web browser, which automatically download to your Playdate. This means that the quick game you intend to play will likely be waiting for you next time you grab the handheld. This fuss-free functionality ensures your quick session is spent playing instead of waiting for an install. It's a feature found on most modern hardware but is nonetheless critical to the Playdate's pick-up-and-play sensibility.

##  Longer Experiences Are Also Available

 Playdate also has its fair share of bulkier experiences. If, like me, your fond Game Boy memories involve cuddling up in a chair with your bulky handheld in tow, Playdate has you covered (and without the bulk). _Saturday Edition_, _Casual Birder_, and _Ratcheteer_ are examples of games bundled with the system that reward players who immerse themselves in their strange worlds. These may have more complex counterparts on the Switch, but there's no substitute for their idiosyncratic attitude. These games don't need to appeal to a mass market to find traction, and while this is not a selling point on its own merits, it does enable them to be refreshingly different.

 You can even "dock" a Playdate via USB-C into your computer using Panic's [Mirror](https://play.date/mirror/) app. Beyond the benefit of a bigger screen for longer sessions, it also allows you to use your [controller of choice](https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-computer-components-with-toms-gear-guides/). However, some games work better than others depending on if and how they use the crank, and it runs counter to the true charm of using the Playdate as a handheld.

##  We Need to Talk About the Crank

 No discussion of the Playdate is complete without remarking on its trademark feature: the crank. This pops out of a nook in the side of the device and is utilized by most games in some capacity. It's transformative at its best, be it adjusting a camera lens or operating it like a beer tap. The clever ways in which developers utilize the crank are endlessly surprising and provide an experience unavailable on any other console. Plus, it's hard to go wrong with the fun-factor of turning a crank.

##  Is The Playdate Right for You?

 If my explanation for why the Playdate is a handheld of choice for me resonates with you, it may be worth a look. The $200 price point is steep, though it does include the aforementioned 24 games as well as tons of free content available online to sideload.

 The development scene for the handheld is very active so you won't need to fret about running out of games to play. It's not a replacement for the meatier offerings on Switch and other consoles, but if you're looking for ways to fill in the gaps in your day with quick gaming sessions, it's one of the best options on the market.
