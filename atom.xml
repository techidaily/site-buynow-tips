Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> If you use your laptop for playing games or running high-performance apps, then you’ve probably seen it get very warm and kick on its potentially loud internal fans. However, the built-in fans can only do so much to dissipate the immense heat built within, try as they might. That’s where laptop cooling pads come in, blasting additional cool air into your laptop to help take down the internal and external temperatures.</p><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.</p><p> Kootek’s Laptop Cooling Pad isn’t the cheapest option around, nor is it the most premium—but it’s effective and sells for a reasonable price, and is large enough to accommodate larger laptops with 17-inch displays. A clunky height adjustment system is the main drawback, but it doesn’t stop the Kootek pad from working as expected.</p><h2 id="Design-Clunky-but-it-works"><a href="#Design-Clunky-but-it-works" class="headerlink" title="Design: Clunky, but it works"></a>Design: Clunky, but it works</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a larger unit, measuring nearly 15 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall, and about 1.4 inches thick, with a weight of 2.6 pounds. It’s heavier and bulkier than the lightweight TopMate C302 Cooling Pad, for example, and feels more durable as a result.</p><p> It’s built for laptops with screens between 12 and 17 inches diagonal, with a wide metal grate on the surface to help dissipate heat as the five fans blow onto your laptop. Most of the rest of the build is plastic. Each fan has red LED lighting for an added glow to the pad.</p><p> The height adjustment system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution.</p><p> Two flip-up, padded stoppers at the bottom of the surface help keep your laptop in place even when you have the pad angled, thanks to the height adjustment system. Granted, that system is easily my least favorite part of this cooling pad.</p><p> Essentially, there’s a loose metal bar hanging from the main unit of the cooling pad, and you’ll slot that into one of six ridges on the bottom stand to prop it up. The system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution. It works and it provides finer-grain height adjustment levels, but it feels like a clunky solution for a tech accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Uuby879oWyaUH6_3WN7ZssAF-g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_04-73dc23f85de34fa087b21b21461f9f74.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> There are two buttons at the back of the pad: One button controls the large, central fan (4.72 inches), while the other controls the four smaller fans (2.76 inches each). I’m not sure why you would choose to use only some fans at any given time, since they’re all quiet, but the option is there if you want it. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, meaning this cooling pad functions as a hub for plugging additional accessories into your laptop.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Very-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Very-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Very straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Very straightforward</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad doesn’t require any software or its own power unit to function. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the height as desired, and then plug the built-in USB cable into your laptop to power it on. As mentioned, you can control the fans using the buttons at the back of the pad, and the USB ports can be used for additional accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A5iJ3c7mD8guT4DKXitqb3wlp6I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_03-9ec8e6afd494441f8ae20c38ae1fadbb.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="864" height="1296" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Cool-and-quiet"><a href="#Performance-Cool-and-quiet" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Cool and quiet"></a>Performance: Cool and quiet</h2><p> I tested the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , featuring an Intel Core i7-9750H processor with 16GB RAM, along with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (6GB). It’s a solidly powerful gaming laptop, and I put it to the test with a couple of popular games as well as a graphics benchmark test.</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid impact in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite.</p><p> I recorded the internal temperature using NZXT’s CAM app and the external temperature with a infrared thermometer, first with the laptop by itself. After it cooled down, I tested again with the cooling pad equipped the whole time.</p><p> In racing game Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade put up an internal processor temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit and external temperature of 117 degrees, but peaked at 169 degrees internal and 107 degrees external with the Kootek pad equipped. The average frame rate was nearly identical between tests, with no significant difference from the use of the cooling pad.</p><p> Meanwhile, I saw a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees when playing Fortnite, along with an external temperature of 118 degrees. With the cooling pad equipped, I saw a slightly lower internal peak of 192 degrees, although it mostly hovered in the 160 to 170-degree range during testing. The external peak with the Kootek pad was 106 degrees. Curiously, I saw the exact same numbers with the Heaven graphics benchmark test with and without the cooling pad: 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees external.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ppFnQ9kEpjbEV9cYbHzLRI5j-j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_05-4a4d5ee065a94c3e984ae0c96f4916d8.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid effort in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite, although the cheaper, dual-fan TopMate C302 cooling pad saw slightly better overall results. Your experience may vary depending on your laptop of choice, however. All the while, the Kootek pad stayed pretty quiet in stark contrast to the Razer Blade’s own very loud internal fans.</p><h2 id="Price-Entirely-reasonable"><a href="#Price-Entirely-reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Entirely reasonable"></a>Price: Entirely reasonable</h2><p> At $26 from Amazon, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops. There are cheaper options out there, as well as some with additional features such as temperature sensors and additional fan controls, but Kootek’s device delivers good functionality for the price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/30UKekQcQjJ1mpixthV5avHNZsE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_02-9e1418002e754b2c8e01cb12f766975a.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043617/7443" target="_top" id="2043617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043617/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302"><a href="#Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302" class="headerlink" title="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302"></a>Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302</h2><p> As mentioned above, the TopMate C302 is a lighter, simpler cooling pad option. It’s designed for laptops up to 15 inches in size and isn’t quite as thick or heavy, but it gets the job done with effective cooling and straightforward design. Kootek’s pad offers an additional USB port for accessories, though, and allows for more height variance than the TopMate’s basic pop-out feet.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good all-around option.</strong></p><p> A clunky design makes the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad a bit awkward in use, but ultimately it does a solid job of cooling hot laptops and accommodating larger-sized devices. The extra USB ports are handy, especially for port-limited laptops, and the price is reasonable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884002/19272" target="_top" id="1884002">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884002" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884002/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  Kootek</li><li>MPN  LCP05</li><li>Price  $35.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2018</li><li>Weight  2.91 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 11.8 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Ports  USB-A x2</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-connectors-companion-instagram-to-tiktok-guide/"><u>[New] The Connector's Companion Instagram to TikTok Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-screen-captures-galore-expert-techniques-for-twitter-visuals/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Screen Captures Galore Expert Techniques for Twitter Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/concealing-your-steam-game-library-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Concealing Your Steam Game Library: Tips and Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/cracking-the-code-on-league-of-legends-voice-chat-problems-effective-solutions-revealed/"><u>Cracking the Code on League of Legends Voice Chat Problems -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 is designed to deliver high-performance features in a low-budget package; this model has a great range and a high-intensity LED display. Let’s take a closer look at some strengths and weaknesses to evaluate what kind of performance you can expect on the road.</p><h2 id="Design-A-bit-cheap"><a href="#Design-A-bit-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A bit cheap"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>A bit cheap</strong></h2><p> The S55 is palm-sized, about comparable in size and shape to most other radar detectors. The plastic material feels a bit cheaper than other radar detectors I’ve tested, though the control buttons worked well and felt long-lasting and I never had issues with them sticking. The Passport S55 comes with a very small windshield mount that’s functional, but you may want to consider an aftermarket mount. It’s minimal with small suction cups and I’m not confident it will last long. Luckily, the lightweight design of the S55 means it doesn’t need much to hold it in place.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display shows bright red text&#x2F;symbols for maximum visibility while driving. The S55 can show four signal strength meters at the same time, plus the numeric frequency of alerts. There’s also a dark mode that turns off the display but doesn’t disable the audio alert.</p><p> The speaker on this radar detector is very small, about a quarter-inch square, but the audio alerts are high volume. You can select between standard and loud tones. The SmartCord power cable for the S55 has a handy mute button on it so you don’t have to reach over the dash.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135399/19272" target="_top" id="2135399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135399/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-installation"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-installation" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy installation"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy installation</strong></h2><p> The S55 is straightforward and easy to install. Simply stick the windshield mount in place and plug the SmartCord lighter adapter into your car’s DC cigarette lighter input. Plugging the modular jack into the S55 will automatically power on the radar detector and you can quickly customize settings for display brightness, detector sensitivity levels, and volume. Then you’re ready to hit the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Range-Impressive-detection"><a href="#Range-Impressive-detection" class="headerlink" title="Range: Impressive detection"></a><strong>Range: Impressive detection</strong></h2><p> The Passport S55 features Enhanced Radar Protection that delivers long-distance range for laser and radar bands, including K and Ka bands, widely used microwave frequencies for police radar guns. It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity. While testing the S55 in Highway mode I received Ka-band alerts over a mile and a half out from where I approached a highway patrol parked on the median of the interstate. This range was on par with much more expensive models.</p><p> It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity.</p><h2 id="Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced"><a href="#Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Not exactly enhanced"></a><strong>Performance: Not exactly enhanced</strong></h2><p> The S55 has different modes designed to adjust to specific frequency bands and sensitivity levels for city or highway driving. You can quickly customize the settings by using the included quick reference guide. You can also turn off specific frequency bands if they tend to give a lot of false alerts.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><p> In terms of false alerts, the AutoSensitivity feature didn’t really help in directing the overall high-sensitivity. This radar detector gave frequent false alerts from commercial door-openers and vehicle anti-collision warning systems. Unfortunately, the S55 lacks the advanced filters of more expensive models that help reduce the annoying frequency of false alerts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $128, the Passport S55 is a low-end radar detector priced accordingly. More advanced radar detectors can easily be several hundred dollars more expensive, and the S55 is a good deal if you plan to use it primarily on the highway. Door-openers along the city and commercial roads will frequently trigger false alerts. You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><p> You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><h2 id="Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector"><a href="#Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector" class="headerlink" title="Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector"></a><strong>Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector</strong></h2><p> A popular competitor brand to Escort that makes a wide selection of radar detectors is Uniden. The Uniden DFR9 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniden-DFR9-Detection-Cameras-Display/dp/B07F6PZXHM/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799949%7Cncd245a3f879640b69fbbb5e95c20e78e20%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a model that can be considered the next price tier above the S55. The DFR9’s MSRP is $300 but it can often be found on sale for about $270.</p><p> The DFR9 has an excellent detection range and a color LED display. The DFR9 also features GPS technology that filters out stationary false alerts, a welcome addition in mid-level radar detectors, and supports database access which alerts you to red light and speed camera locations.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A basic radar detector that’s ideal for beginners or anyone on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 has reliable long-range detection, but I found its performance and range of features to be pretty basic. This unit never missed the presence of parked police down the highway who appeared to be using radar guns, which means I’m confident in recommending this model for those on a budget. However, buyer beware that false alerts are an unavoidable inconvenience with this model.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Passport S55</li><li>Product Brand  Escort</li><li>SKU  B019HF60EI</li><li>Price  $189.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.6 x 3.75 x 1 in.</li><li>Warranty  Limited One Year Warranty</li><li>Display size  1&#x2F;4”H x 1 3&#x2F;4”L</li><li>Display type  280 LED Matrix&#x2F;Text</li><li>Radar receiver  Superheterodyne, Varactor-Tuned VCO, Scanning Frequency, Discriminator, Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</li><li>Power requirements  12 VDC, Negative Ground (car lighter&#x2F;accessory)</li><li>GPS  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-step-by-step-guide-to-obs-streaming-success/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Step-by-Step Guide to OBS Streaming Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fostering-followers-with-flashy-instagram-puzzles-that-stand-out/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Fostering Followers with Flashy Instagram Puzzles that Stand Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/apple-tv-4k-vs-roku-ultra-face-off-best-choice-for-your-home-entertainment/"><u>Apple TV 4K vs Roku Ultra Face-Off: Best Choice for Your Home Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/apply-these-techniques-to-improve-how-to-detect-fake-gps-location-on-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Apply These Techniques to Improve How to Detect Fake GPS Location On Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-powerhouse-the-apple-ipad-air-4-exposed/"><u>Budget-Friendly Powerhouse: The Apple iPad Air 4 Exposed!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/cutting-connections-between-fb-and-its-browser/"><u>Cutting Connections Between FB and Its Browser</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/fintie-macbook-pro-13-casing-examined-quality-meets-affordability/"><u>Fintie MacBook Pro 13 Casing Examined – Quality Meets Affordability!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-tecno-spark-20c-phone-password-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Tecno Spark 20C Phone Password Without Factory Reset?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-preparation-to-beat-giovani-in-pokemon-go-for-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-samsung-galaxy-a25-5g-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Samsung Galaxy A25 5G Phone Password Without Factory Reset Full Guide Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/in-depth-fixes-for-call-of-duty-vanguard-dev-bug-error-number-5573-explained/"><u>In-Depth Fixes for Call of Duty Vanguard Dev Bug -

well</li></ul><p> While many of the best external optical drives go for a smaller form factor, making them easier to travel, this pick for top performance goes big. The ASUS BW-16D1X-U measures 2.48 x 6.50 x 9.57 inches, making it a bit of a desk hog, but with that extra size, you get serious performance for every task.</p><p> The ASUS BW-16D1X-U has fast access times on all types of optical media, so you’ll spend less time waiting around. It can access CD-ROM at 160ms, DVD-ROM at 170ms, and BD-ROM at 180ms. Its read and write performance is also stellar, with 40x, 16x, and 8x read speeds in CD, DVD, and Blu-ray, respectively. Likewise, it can burn CD-R at 40x, DVD-R at 16x, and BD-R at 16x.</p><p> So, whether you want to rip media from discs or burn data to them, the Asus BW-16D1X-U can do the job quickly. It also supports BDXL, allowing storage of up to 128GB on a single, compatible disc. Making the package even sweeter, the ASUS BW-16D1X-U supports Windows and Mac computers.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-bw-16d1x-u-blu-ray-drive-review-4774686" >Asus BW-16D1X-U Powerful Blu-ray Drive Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >LG GP65NB60 External Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Txzj4YX23tuIUnOsOlRGMfzEON8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/lg-electronics-8x-usb-20-super-multi-ultra-slim-portable-dvd-writer-drive---rw-external-drive-with-m-disc-support-black-gp65nb60-e74c64d858fc4e968d809333a31078d1.jpg" >LG Electronics 8X USB 2.0 Super Multi Ultra Slim Portable DVD Writer Drive +&#x2F;-RW External Drive with M-DISC Support (Black) GP65NB60 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ODDE33U?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00ODDE33U" >$25 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Reads and writes CDs and DVDs</li><li>Lightweight and very portable</li><li>You have color options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Cheap build quality</li><li>Poorly designed eject function</li></ul><p> If you don’t need the Blu-ray capabilities offered by some of the more premium external optical drives, you can get a great deal on a CD&#x2F;DVD drive. LG’s GP65NB60 is a low-profile and affordable combo drive that offers both read and write capability for CD and DVD. Measuring 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches and weighing just 0.4 pounds, it even gives our top compact pick a run for its money.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 can read CD-ROM at 24x speeds and DVD-ROM at 8x speeds, meaning it’s not lagging behind most of the competition despite its budget price. Write speeds are also decent, with up to 24x on CD-R and up to 8x on DVD-R.</p><p> The LG GP65NB60 needs a single USB connection for all its power and data transfer needs. Further rounding out the package, the LG GP65NB60 supports Windows and Mac, can burn archival-quality M-Disc, and comes in various colors, with black, gold, white, and silver on offer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137208/26400" target="_top" id="2137208">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137208" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137208/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Most-Compact"><a href="#Most-Compact" class="headerlink" title="Most Compact"></a>Most Compact</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >Verbatim External Slimline Blu-ray Writer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BO4kmGezMrCvhvw2CCVi4n592BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/verbatim-external-cd-dvd-blu-ray-writer-usb-30-m-disc-ready---movie-playback-requires-playback-software-not-included-67c2a99c85c4425298b176462124e43b.jpg" >Verbatim External CD DVD Blu-ray Writer USB 3.0 M-Disc Ready - Movie playback requires playback software (not included) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PY6SC9Y?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB09PY6SC9Y" >$126 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Solid metal case</li><li>M-Disc support</li><li>Comes with USB Type-C adapter</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Doesn’t include software</li><li>Isn’t cheap</li><li>Fragile tray</li></ul><p> Many modern laptops forgo an optical drive to trim their size and weight. But that reduction wouldn’t be valuable if you need an optical drive.</p><p> Measuring just 0.45 x 5.24 x 5.75 inches, the Verbatim 70102 is super compact. What’s more, the reduction in size doesn’t mean a bunch of compromises. It’s built with metal housing for a premium look and feel and is speedy.</p><p> It can write CDs at 24x, DVDs at 8x, and Blu-rays at 6x — even supporting M-Disc. It’s a CD&#x2F;DVD&#x2F;BD drive weighing less than half a pound. The Verbatim 70102 is a mobility champion, with power and data transfer over USB, so you’ll only need one cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052062/7443" target="_top" id="2052062">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052062" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052062/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Alternative"><a href="#Budget-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Budget Alternative"></a>Budget Alternative</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >Dell DW316 External USB Slim DVD Drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uXbXWSHrSmk0WgSQeogs9WgkNz0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316--black-5ec791f7068744c3bc87e2e91130a9c1.jpg" >dell-usb-dvd-drive-dw316–black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VWVZ0V0?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4584282%7Cn9fb481254e8d4bb28df89d8e8fa48e0421%7CB00VWVZ0V0" >$26 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/EXT-USB-SLIM-DVD-RW-OPTICAL-DRIVE-429-AAUX/44933803" >$34 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-usb-slim-dvd-rw-drive-plug-and-play-dw316-black/4697703.p?skuId=4697703" >$40 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works immediately</li><li>Includes DVD burning software</li><li>Easy to move around</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>A bit pricey for what you get</li><li>Flimsy exterior</li></ul><p> The Dell DW316 measures 0.55 x 5.41 x 5.67 inches, making it both a budget and compact contender.

This simple CD&#x2F;DVD combo drive does not support Blu-Ray, so it comes at a substantially lower price. It measures just 0.55 x 5.33 x 5.61 inches, and it needs a single USB connection for power.</p><p> The ZenDrive offers excellent performance for its size, with CD read and write speeds up to 24x and DVD read and write speeds up to 8x. Furthering that performance are quick access times; the Asus ZenDrive can access CD and DVD content in 160ms. For anyone who needs archival quality, the ZenDrive also supports burning to M-Disc for long-lasting data storage.</p><p> The Asus ZenDrive supports Windows and Mac, and it includes CyberLink software to help you get started storing content on physical media. The drive also comes with six months of free cloud storage from ASUS, so you can rip content from your CDs and DVDs and move it there as needed.</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For"><a href="#What-to-Look-For" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For"></a>What to Look For</h2><p> For people who own and consume lots of media, an indispensable external optical drive is one of your best bets. External optical drives allow you to store massive amounts of data, including photos, videos, and software from CDs and DVDs, with easy access whenever and wherever you need it.</p><p> With hundreds of external optical drives on the market, finding the right one may take a lot of work. However, we’ve narrowed our top selections to the top four. We evaluated using five criteria: connectivity, compatibility, read&#x2F;write speeds, portability, and optional features such as low power consumption and M-Disc support.</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p><p> Our preferred external optical drive supports USB 3.0 or higher for faster data transfer speeds. It should also be compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android OS, and FireOS, which is preferable for users with multiple devices running different file types of all sizes.</p><p> Almost all external optical drives have a micro USB port, although the larger mini USB can save more files.</p><p> Other areas to consider with connectivity include BDXL support, which allows you to store all your files on a 128GB disc.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p> In addition to supporting standard CDs and DVDs, bolster your data processing power by choosing models with Blu-ray disc support. Ensure your preferred format is supported to avoid any returns due to compatibility issues.</p><p> If you store a lot of precious digital data, like family photos, you may want to explore external optical drives offering M-Disc support. These drives promise to last 1,000 years versus 7-10 years for standard DVDs before losing image quality.</p><p><strong>Read&#x2F;Write Speeds</strong></p><p> In short, the faster the read and write speeds, the quicker it will take to transfer large files or burn discs. Read speeds indicate how long it takes to open files, while write speeds indicate how long it takes to save data. At a minimum, look for read and write speeds of 40x (CDs), 16x (DVDs), and 16x (Blu-ray), although the higher, the better. No wonder why our Best Overall pick is the ASUS BW-16D1X-U Blu-ray Drive with read speeds of 8x (Blu-ray), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD) versus write speeds of 16x (BD-R), 16x (DVD), and 40x (CD).</p><p><strong>Portability</strong></p><p> If you’re constantly on the go, we highly recommend a slim and lightweight design that is easy to carry around. One perfect example is the LG GP65NB60 External Drive, which is only 0.6 x 5.4 x 5.6 inches. It should be small enough to fit in a laptop bag, person, or backpack. Plus, many of them come with integrated cables, which keep your bags clutter-free and cord-free.</p><p><strong>Optional Features</strong></p><p> Other areas to consider when choosing an external optical drive are its durability and build quality. Check for ones with anti-scratch coatings, shock resistance, and sturdy construction to withstand wear and tear, especially when traveling, as they constantly get knocked in your luggage.</p><p> On the usability side, you may also enjoy external optical drives with silent operation and low power consumption, which offer a more comfortable working environment.</p><p> Kudos for any external optical drive with M-Disc support, as well as bundled backup software or free subscriptions to cloud services that offer even more robust backups.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cd-players-and-changers-1846562" >The Best CD Players and CD Changers of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What are the advantages of an optical drive?<br> With media increasingly moving to digital rather than physical storage solutions, an optical drive may seem outdated. But there are still many reasons to invest in an optical drive, not the least of which is to access older media, a significant percentage of which still hasn’t been shifted to a digital&#x2F;online solution. This is especially true if you have games, videos, photos, or documents backed up on physical media. Optical drives can also be a handy way to create new backups quickly and inexpensively, and some programs require discs for emergency boot tools.</li><li>Can you read a DVD in a Blu-Ray drive?<br> Yes, both CDs and DVDs are compatible with Blu-Ray drives, and there are combo drives that can burn discs of all three types as well. By contrast, DVD drives cannot read Blu-Ray media.</li><li>How does an optical drive work?<br> Optical drives read and write data to discs using a laser. The laser creates pits in an organic dye layer on the disc’s surface to write, the reflected light from which can then be read by photodiodes in the drive and converted back into the original data. The disc spins, allowing the laser to read the tracks on its surface consecutively. If you’re not using a CD, dozens of supported YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> channels specialize in Karaoke videos, such as Singtrix and Sing King.

It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> Generous cutouts allow for easy access to all ports, and vents on the bottom of the case help to maintain airflow and keep your computer from overheating. Fintie offers a number of color and style options, from the Vintage Leather look that we tested to playful graphic prints and sleek solid colors.</p><p> It’s robust enough to protect your laptop from scratches, abrasions, and impact from minor drops without feeling too bulky.</p><p> The synthetic leather provides a comfortable grip, and that meant a great deal to us when we were assessing the overall utility of the case. It’s comfortable to walk around with it in your hands, and there’s enough traction in the synthetic leather to keep it from slipping in most cases. The Fintie also offers a host of other color and style options to allow for a little customization.</p><p> One more plus? Contrary to some other options, this case is easy to put on and take off, fitting much like a second skin. It is loose enough to remove without a hassle and tight enough to effectively protect your computer. And the case doesn’t interfere with your use of the laptop at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oLEmxLNytxQINRktM9nWjKfhTZ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4153328-4-ec18ce2eec6b4e73853f562114489d01.jpg"                      alt="Fintie Protective Case for MacBook Pro 13"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Hayley Prokos</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082539/7443" target="_top" id="2082539">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082539" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082539/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-No-instructions-needed"><a href="#Setup-Process-No-instructions-needed" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: No instructions needed"></a><strong>Setup Process: No instructions needed</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve unwrapped this product, there’s no need to read any instructions—the case requires little setup.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="More-Commercials-on-the-Horizon-Amazon’s-Plan-to-Increase-Prime-Video-Advertisements"><a href="#More-Commercials-on-the-Horizon-Amazon’s-Plan-to-Increase-Prime-Video-Advertisements" class="headerlink" title="More Commercials on the Horizon: Amazon’s Plan to Increase Prime Video Advertisements"></a>More Commercials on the Horizon: Amazon’s Plan to Increase Prime Video Advertisements</h2><p>Amazon kicked off the new year by filling its Prime Video service with ads. Now, in the face of user complaints, Amazon is doubling down with a slew of “interactive” ads. These ads extend beyond the normal commercial break and will appear on the pause menu.</p><p> As described in a <a class="link"   href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-ads-announces-three-new-streaming-tv-ad-formats" >press release <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Prime Video will encourage users to shop during advertisements through the use of interactive “carousel,” “pause,” and “trivia” ads. Carousel ads are pretty straightforward—you can shop for stuff on your TV during ad breaks. Once you enter the carousel (by pressing a certain button on your remote), the ad will pause so you can shop around. Once you exit the carousel, the ad will resume.</p><p> Interactive pause ads offer an “extended engagement opportunity beyond a typical ad break.” You pause a show or movie, and a product appears on-screen with “buy now” and “learn more” buttons. Amazon says that these ads will sit on the pause menu “for as long as the content is paused.”</p><p> Things get a little weird with Amazon’s “brand trivia ads,” which are tailored to specific shows, movies, and live sports content. Basically, these ads will hook customers with an entertaining trivia question and create a path to shopping on Amazon. Trivia ads may also offer special “rewards,” such as Amazon account credits, to encourage user interaction. It’s unclear whether these ads will interrupt your programming or simply appear during the ad break.</p><blockquote><p>“Interactive pause ads, which enable customers to discover and engage with brands when they decide to pause the show or movie they’re streaming. When viewers press pause on their living-room remote, they will see a translucent ad featuring brand messaging and imagery, along with an “Add to Cart” and “Learn More” creative overlay. “</p></blockquote><p> Amazon previously claimed that Prime Video would have a “smaller ad load” than other streaming platforms. Presumably, the company was referring to ad breaks, rather than advertisements as a whole. I’m curious to see how the introduction of pause-menu ads will shape users’ perception of the Prime Video service and its value. The trivia ads, if done in an obnoxious way, could actually be more annoying than the pause-menu ads.</p><p> In any case, the future of streaming is ads. Streaming platforms are transitioning to an ad-supported model because it’s <em>more</em> profitable than a simple monthly fee. And Amazon isn’t the only company that’s trying to find strange, annoying ways to shove advertisements down peoples’ throats—Roku recently submitted a patent for an <a class="link"   href="https://www.designrush.com/news/roku-tv-may-display-tailored-ads-every-time-you-pause#:~:text=The%20patent%20application%20for%20%E2%80%9CHDMI,other%20displays%20connected%20via%20HDMI" >ad-insertion method <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that works across all of a TV’s HDMI inputs.</p><p> I should note that Amazon has a unique advantage in the ad-streaming space—it knows a lot about its customers. The Amazon storefront collects data based on how you shop, Alexa smart home products log every command you make, and over 25% of the web is <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,with%2010%20percent%20market%20share" >powered by AWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> cloud services. Targeted advertising, which leverages private user data, is a cash cow. That’s why Amazon reported <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259814/amazons-worldwide-advertising-revenue-development/" >$46.91 billion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in advertising revenue last year.</p><p> For reference, a standalone Prime Video subscription is currently $9 a month. Customers who want ad-free Prime Video must pay an extra $3, which brings the service to $12 a month. Admittedly, this is cheaper than most other ad-free streaming services, but it’s nearly the same price as a full-fat Amazon Prime membership. Amazon Prime is currently $15 a month and includes ad-supported Prime Video.</p><p> Source: <a class="link"   href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-ads-announces-three-new-streaming-tv-ad-formats" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-techniques-for-effective-display-saving-on-dell/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unveiling Techniques for Effective Display Saving on Dell</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-6-essential-lite-videos-downloader-apps-for-facebook/"><u>[New] Top 6 Essential Lite Videos Downloader Apps for Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/urn-the-table-youtube-reversal-techniques-and-tutorials/"><u>[New] Turn the Table YouTube Reversal Techniques & Tutorials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-comfort-and-durability-the-fellowes-microban-wired-keyboard-reviewed/"><u>Affordable Comfort & Durability: The Fellowes Microban Wired Keyboard Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-security-discovering-the-remobell-reviews-and-features-for-less-than-100/"><u>Affordable Security: Discovering the RemoBell Reviews and Features for Less Than $100</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/discovering-the-ideal-location-for-your-playstation-4-camera-setup/"><u>Discovering the Ideal Location for Your PlayStation 4 Camera Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/expert-evaluation-of-the-netatmo-weather-station-the-ultimate-gadget-for-mobile-device-lovers/"><u>Expert Evaluation of the Netatmo Weather Station: The Ultimate Gadget For Mobile Device Lovers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-can-nokia-c210mirror-share-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How Can Nokia C210Mirror Share to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-vivo-y56-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Stop My Spouse from Spying on My Vivo Y56 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/leading-portable-storage-solutions-your-2024-essential-list/"><u>Leading Portable Storage Solutions: Your 2024 Essential List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/linkedins-advanced-features-worth-the-extra-dollars-right/"><u>LinkedIn's Advanced Features Worth the Extra Dollars, Right?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/phones-as-cameras-a-comprehensive-guide-to-mobile-video-production-for-2024/"><u>Phones as Cameras A Comprehensive Guide to Mobile Video Production for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/the-pathway-to-viral-fame-mastering-instagram-with-these-9-essential-strategies-for-2024/"><u>The Pathway to Viral Fame Mastering Instagram with These 9 Essential Strategies for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-secrets-behind-rayman-legends-a-critique-of-an-immersive-2d-platform-gaming-experience/"><u>Unveiling the Secrets Behind Rayman Legends: A Critique of an Immersive 2D Platform Gaming Experience</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135402/19272" target="_top" id="2135402">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135402" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135402/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Prepare-for-Premium-Pricing-with-Max-Offerings"><a href="#Prepare-for-Premium-Pricing-with-Max-Offerings" class="headerlink" title="Prepare for Premium Pricing with Max Offerings"></a>Prepare for Premium Pricing with Max Offerings</h2><p>Popular streaming services have gradually become more expensive over the past few years, and that trend is not stopping. Max, the service owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, is now raising prices again.</p><p> Max, which used to be called HBO Max, just raised prices across most of its monthly and yearly plans. The “Ad-Free” plan has jumped from $15.99 per month to $16.99&#x2F;month, while the “Ultimate Ad-Free” plan increased from $19.99&#x2F;month to $20.99&#x2F;month. The Ad-Free plan limits you to two devices streaming at once, and it limits the maximum resolution to 1080p. The Ultimate plan bumps that up to four devices and 4K, and it adds support for Dolby Atmos audio.</p><p> The yearly pricing is also going up, but you still get a savings of roughly 16% compared to paying each month for a year—assuming you want Max continuously for a year, anyway. The Ad-Free plan now costs $169.99&#x2F;year, and Ultimate Ad-Free costs $209.99&#x2F;year.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/screenshot-2024-06-04-at-16-01-37-choose-your-plan-o-max.png"                      alt="Choose your Plan screen on Max website"                > </p><p>Max</p><p> The only plan not changing in price is the “With Ads” plan, which is staying at $9.99&#x2F;month or $99.99&#x2F;year. That’s the same pattern we’ve seen with <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/emystifying-video-seo-on-youtube-as-a-novice/" >Netflix’s continuous price increases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The ad-supported plans are much more profitable for streaming services, so streaming services keep them inexpensive to bring in new subscribers. For comparison, Netflix’s ad-supported plan is $6.99&#x2F;month, while Netflix Premium has ballooned to $22.99&#x2F;month.</p><p> This is the first increase in pricing for Max since <a class="link"   href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/supercharge-gaming-on-acer-predator-helios-nv-gpus-with-latest-drivers/" >January 2023 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was back when it was still called HBO Max. That was the first time the ad-free version ever changed in price, but given this news and other streaming services trying similar tactics, this will probably be an annual tradition.</p><p> This is also a great reminder that cycling streaming services is the best way to watch everything you want—when a show ends or you’ve seen all the movies you care about on one service, cancel your subscription and switch to something else for a while. That’s a lot cheaper than paying for multiple streaming services at once.

Thanks to the arrival of some new hardware, buying used Switch games could land you in hot water with Nintendo. Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id="Introducing-the-MiG-Switch-Card-and-ROM-Dumper"><a href="#Introducing-the-MiG-Switch-Card-and-ROM-Dumper" class="headerlink" title="Introducing the MiG Switch Card and ROM Dumper"></a>Introducing the MiG Switch Card and ROM Dumper</h2><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://migswitch.com/#/" >MiG Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> card is a flash cartridge designed for all models of Nintendo Switch that allows you to play Switch games directly from a microSD card. The MiG Switch Dumper is a device for “dumping” software copies of games (known as ROMs) to an SD card for use with the MiG Switch card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mig_switch_dumper.jpg"                      alt="MiG Switch Dumper game dumping device."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151860/7443" target="_top" id="2151860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>MiG Switch</p><p> It’s been possible to dump Switch ROMs for years using a <a class="link"   href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/above-and-beyond-uavs-for-gopro-recording-excellence-for-2024/" >modified Switch that’s running custom firmware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Dumped ROMs typically consist of a single file that can be played using modified Nintendo hardware or on an emulator. While emulating a platform isn’t necessarily illegal, <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-video-revenue-generation-on-facebook-tactics-for-financial-growth-for-2024/" >creating ROMs may be, and disseminating them certainly is <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Until now, it wasn’t possible to spit out an exact replica of a game cartridge. Notably absent was the ROM certificate, a file that identifies each Nintendo Switch cartridge as a unique entity. This is what makes it possible to <a class="link"   href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-visionboost-converter-windows-mac-online-version/" >claim Nintendo Rewards once per cartridge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> The MiG Switch changes that. Thanks to the presence of a cheap, sub-$10 <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32" >ESP32 microcontroller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and an FPGA—a type of chip that can be reprogrammed on the fly—the MiG Switch dumper can grab all of the data from a Switch game cartridge, including that all-important unique ROM certificate.</p><p> With these files, the MiG Switch card can perfectly emulate a unique cartridge. The Switch console cannot tell the difference between the original game card and the MiG Switch with a microSD card in it. In the US, the MiG Switch card and ROM dumper cost around $70 each at retail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mig_switch_disclaimer.png"                      alt="The disclaimer on the MiG Switch website."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484910/16446" target="_top" id="1484910">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484910" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484910/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> These devices are marketed at those who want to create backups of their physical game cartridges so that they only need to carry a single cartridge with them to access a range of games.

Switch pirates playing on original hardware know all too well that their consoles could be banned by Nintendo, which is why playing pirated titles in an offline state is so important.</p><p> But now the game has changed. Switch games and <a class="link"   href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-reducing-excessive-encoding-obs-for-2024/" >Nintendo titles, in general, are notoriously expensive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Buying second-hand is a great strategy for anyone looking to save some money. Cartridges are more durable than the optical media used by Sony and Microsoft consoles, so there’s been relatively little risk in doing so until now.</p><p> Let’s say you’re looking to pick up a used copy of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. You pay your money, receive the game, put it in your Switch, and everything works as expected. But it turns out that the seller has cloned the game without your knowledge. They don’t disclose this fact to you, and there’s very little you could have done to avoid it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nintendo_switch_green_pink.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch console with green and pink JoyCon controllers."                > </p><p>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Nintendo notices that two copies of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> with the same unique cartridge identifier are online at the same time. Who do they ban? Now let’s say that the seller has uploaded this version of the game and shared it with thousands or potentially millions of people.</p><p> You won’t know, your Switch won’t know, but Nintendo will know. What are the odds of your console being banned? You did nothing wrong, after all. The MiG Switch got a final release in early 2024, but in time the hardware and its clones will saturate the market and the problem will become far more widespread.</p><h2 id="Fake-Games-Could-Flood-the-Market"><a href="#Fake-Games-Could-Flood-the-Market" class="headerlink" title="Fake Games Could Flood the Market"></a>Fake Games Could Flood the Market</h2><p> Now that the cat is out of the bag, there’s a real concern that the problem will scale up exponentially. Considering that the Switch cannot tell the difference between a device like the MiG Switch card and a genuine Switch cartridge, we may be about to see an explosion in counterfeit Switch games.</p><p> One thing we know is that the chips inside the MiG Switch are relatively inexpensive, as are memory modules. The MiG Switch card and its dumper are being sold at a premium due to demand and market position in the early stages. These costs will fall, especially at scale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/game_carts.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch game cards."                > </p><p>Tim Brookes &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Counterfeiting operations are big business, and markups on video games are particularly lucrative. This is bound to be an attractive proposition for someone operating outside of the law. These games could easily be passed off as the genuine article on online marketplaces.</p><p> By the time the seller has been rumbled, they’ve set up shop elsewhere and moved on. With so many Switch consoles in the wild, there’s a strong demand for games especially at prices that undercut typical brick and mortar retailers.</p><h2 id="What-Can-You-Do"><a href="#What-Can-You-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Can You Do?"></a>What Can You Do?</h2><p> There are a few things that you can do to avoid buying a cloned game or a counterfeit title. The first is to stay away from the used game market entirely. Only buy new game cartridges from trusted resellers, or buy digitally via the Nintendo eShop.</p><p> Remember that retailers who deal in used games are also potentially at risk of disseminating cloned copies. Brand-new games shouldn’t be an issue as long as you trust the retailer. Unfortunately, this means paying top dollar for your games.</p><p> It’s also worth noting that you should be careful when lending any games to friends or associates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139107/17108" target="_top" id="2139107">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139107" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139107/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Will-Nintendo-Do"><a href="#What-Will-Nintendo-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Will Nintendo Do?"></a>What Will Nintendo Do?</h2><p> At the time of writing in March 2024, Nintendo has yet to acknowledge the problem. It’s impossible to predict how to deal with these problems. Banning accounts that have unwittingly fallen victim to cartridge seems unnecessarily harsh. At the same time, it’s unlikely that ignoring the problem is an option for the Big N.</p><p> With the follow-up to the Switch on the horizon, Nintendo has the option of cutting the Switch off entirely and starting fresh. But there’s bound to be a backlash if a successor doesn’t include some sort of backward compatibility with existing libraries.</p><p> It’s also not Nintendo’s style to simply drop a platform, particularly one as successful as the Switch. The Nintendo 3DS continued to receive new releases for years after the Switch was released.</p><hr><p> For now we’ll have to wait and see what happens. Since the MiG Switch hardware is manufactured in Russia, it’s going to be a challenge for Nintendo to shut down production. It’s also unlikely that this will help in the longterm, as copycat devices appear that offer the exact same functionality.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-optimal-tools-for-educators-lesson-archiving/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Optimal Tools for Educator's Lesson Archiving</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-make-your-cash-flow-with-these-13-reddit-techniques-for-beginners/"><u>2024 Approved Make Your Cash Flow with These 13 Reddit Techniques for Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-television-archive-advanced-techniques-for-online-streams/"><u>2024 Approved Television Archive Advanced Techniques for Online Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-telegram-edge-advanced-tactics-for-effective-promotion/"><u>2024 Approved The Telegram Edge Advanced Tactics for Effective Promotion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-gimp-image-editing-software-evaluation-a-cross-platform-approach/"><u>Comprehensive GIMP Image Editing Software Evaluation: A Cross-Platform Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-petsafe-automatic-feeder-aiding-in-your-furry-friends-ideal-weight/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the PetSafe Automatic Feeder - Aiding in Your Furry Friend's Ideal Weight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-test-drive-of-synology-rt2-ac-wireless-router-featuring-extended-coverage-and-superior-parenting-options/"><u>Comprehensive Test Drive of Synology RT2# AC Wireless Router - Featuring Extended Coverage & Superior Parenting Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/corsair-one-pro-assessment-the-ultimate-creation-station-for-gamers/"><u>Corsair One Pro Assessment: The Ultimate Creation Station for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/easy-walkthrough-crafting-your-first-cd-with-windows-10-features/"><u>Easy Walkthrough: Crafting Your First CD with Windows 10 Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-simulate-gps-movement-with-location-spoofer-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Apple iPhone 12 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-transcribe-speech-absolutely-gratis/"><u>In 2024, Transcribe Speech, Absolutely Gratis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/pixelperfect-tools-overview-series/"><u>PixelPerfect Tools Overview Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/solved-warning-camera-failed-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Solved Warning Camera Failed on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983446">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983446">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983446%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983446/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-hobby-to-career-the-transition-to-youtube-gaming/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Hobby to Career The Transition to YouTube Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-market-precision-strategic-package-interpretations/"><u>[New] Market Precision Strategic Package Interpretations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-blueprint-crafting-engaging-youtube-content-via-windows-movie-maker/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Blueprint Crafting Engaging YouTube Content via Windows Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-the-power-of-messaging-mastering-pinning-on-discord/"><u>[Updated] Unleash the Power of Messaging Mastering Pinning on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-sketching-your-signature-tiktok-end-note/"><u>2024 Approved Sketching Your Signature TikTok End-Note</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/escaping-boredom-with-a-chuckle-best-fb-incarceration-comical-stories-for-2024/"><u>Escaping Boredom with a Chuckle Best FB Incarceration Comical Stories for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-limitations-of-googles-latest-nest-hub-gen-2-the-lack-of-a-camera-feature-examined/"><u>Exploring the Limitations of Google's Latest Nest Hub (Gen 2) - The Lack of a Camera Feature Examined</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-realme-12-5g-adb-format-tool-for-pc-vs-other-unlocking-tools-which-one-is-the-best-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Realme 12 5G ADB Format Tool for PC vs. Other Unlocking Tools Which One is the Best?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-assessment-of-amazonbasicss-top-security-12-sheets-micro-cut-destroyer/"><u>In-Depth Assessment of AmazonBasics's Top Security 12-Sheets Micro Cut Destroyer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/premium-asus-wifi-routers-2024s-leading-choices/"><u>Premium Asus WiFi Routers: 2024'S Leading Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/stylish-and-trendy-swagtron-swagger-e-scooter-review-your-ultimate-modern-transportation-companion/"><u>Stylish & Trendy Swagtron Swagger E-Scooter Review: Your Ultimate Modern Transportation Companion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-community.techidaily.com/top-5-mac-compatible-subtitling-tools-to-enhance-your-videos/"><u>Top 5 Mac-Compatible Subtitling Tools to Enhance Your Videos</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Even in a post-<em>Elden Ring</em> world, <em>Bloodborne</em> remains a favorite of many die-hard FromSoftware fans. Considering it’s a PlayStation-exclusive title, the fact that <em>Bloodborne</em> is available in the Game Catalog means that subscribing to PlayStation Plus Extra is perhaps the most economical way to enjoy this one-of-a-kind experience.</p><hr><p> Subscribing to PlayStation Plus Extra costs just a fraction of what you would pay buying a new game at full price.

Unfortunately, all Car Thing players are about to turn into bricks.</p><p> Spotify is notifying Car Thing owners that the device will soon be discontinued, and it will stop working entirely after December 9th, 2024. Spotify recommends resetting the device to factory settings and then “safely disposing of your device following local electronic waste guidelines.” There is no trade-in program available for Spotify to properly dispose of the device for you.</p><p> Spotify initially made Car Thing available to select Spotify users, before expanding its availability to anyone with a Spotify Premium account in the United States <a class="link"   href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/understanding-the-quantum-leap-hdr-innovations-for-2024/" >in early 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It was a device that could be attached to a car dashboard, with its own touch screen interface for selecting playlists, searching for music, and controlling playback. However, it still relied on a connected smartphone for its data connection, so it wasn’t all that useful if you already had Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.</p><p> Car Thing didn’t last long, as Spotify <a class="link"   href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-personalize-and-edit-iphone-ringtones-easily/" >confirmed a few months later <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that it had stopped manufacturing due to “several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues.” The player was sold for a while longer at a fire sale price of $50, a discount of $40 from the original price (on top of the cost of the required Spotify Premium membership).</p><p> Unfortunately, Spotify also still doesn’t have plans to sell a new Car Thing or any similar devices. A support page explains, “As of now, there are no plans to release a replacement or new version of Car Thing.”</p><p> It’s not great that Spotify is turning all Car Thing players into bricks, especially after <a class="link"   href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-04-07/spotifys-car-thing-device-debuts-new-features/" >software updates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allowed it to control other media sources and answer calls from the connected phone. It probably wouldn’t be too difficult for Spotify to keep those features functional while dropping support for the Spotify-specific features, but the company isn’t willing to do that.</p><p> The mobile Spotify app still has a Car Mode that makes buttons and other interface elements larger, so that feature combined with <a class="link"   href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/faster-film-fun-time-lapse-techniques-for-iphones/" >a phone mount <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be a partial replacement for Car Thing.

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> Although the core functionality is typically the same, laptop cooling pads come in a variety of designs and with different features. Some are robust and durable and may pack in additional perks, while some stick to the absolute basics, aiming to win out on pure bang for buck.</p><p> The TopMate C302 is a strong example of the latter. It’s affordable and solidly effective, but the plastic design feels a bit flimsy. I wouldn’t bet on it lasting for the long haul without gentle handling, but given the price, you might not worry about it too much.</p><h2 id="Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy"><a href="#Design-Light-and-a-little-flimsy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Light and a little flimsy"></a>Design: Light and a little flimsy</h2><p> The C302 measures just over 14 inches wide and is designed for laptops with screens up to 15.6 inches diagonal. It’s primarily made of lightweight plastic, with a thin metal grate on the top above the two 4.9-inch fans to help dissipate heat.</p><p> The entire pad weighs only 1.1 pounds, but the downside to it being so lightweight is that it feels a bit flimsy and rickety. It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3qjwZzxQ2KVhmQJOdD2R9jBegvI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_03-ed7074949b6f4e4794ce30be2d582058.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> It has two little flip-up stopper nubs at the bottom to hold your laptop in place, and they can be gradually adjusted to avoid having them stick up and press into your wrists while typing. Meanwhile, a pair of feet on the bottom of the pad flip out to elevate your laptop about an inch upward to improve air circulation.</p><p> A single cable comes from the back of the pad to plug into a USB-A port on your computer, and it has a pass-through so that you can plug in another accessory, so as to not sacrifice a port simply to use the cooling pad. That’s handy.</p><p> It’ll do just fine holding your laptop and sitting on a desk, but I wouldn’t bet on it surviving a hard fall without some damage.</p><p> The C302 has a little bit of accent lighting via a pair of blue lights beneath each fan, but it doesn’t emanate a significant glow, nor is it customizable in any way.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a>Setup Process: Plug and play</h2><p> The C302 is a purely plug-and-play accessory with no flashy perks or settings to deal with, nor any need for software on your computer. Simply place it under your laptop, adjust the feet and holding nubs as desired, and plug the USB port into your computer to power on the pad. The fans will then activate and run at the only available speed, and you can unplug it when you’re done or don’t need it anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xhFp_B4P4BG8gb4dtJAGBbXPAlw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_05-4ce850d84f4a4e1d931588e23f39cb82.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111964/7443" target="_top" id="2111964">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111964" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111964/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-It-makes-a-difference"><a href="#Performance-It-makes-a-difference" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It makes a difference"></a>Performance: It makes a difference</h2><p> I tested the C302 using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) gaming laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is equipped with an Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB RAM, as well as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU (6GB).</p><p> This lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Across two recent, popular games and a graphics-intensive benchmark test, I first tested the laptop on its own and recorded the internal processor temperature using the NZXT CAM app, as well as the external temperature of the laptop using an infrared thermometer. After allowing the laptop to cool down, I repeated the process with the cooling pad in use.</p><p> In Fortnite, the Razer Blade 15 recorded a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees Fahrenheit and 118 degrees externally, while the cooling pad dropped those numbers to 179 degrees internal and 115 degrees external.</p><p> In Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade 15 hit 184 degrees internally and 117° externally, and those figures dropped to 175 degrees internally and 100 degrees externally with the cooling pad. There was no significant performance difference in the Dirt 5 benchmark when using the cooling pad: The average FPS mark was within one frame with or without the pad in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Xs71AyeThjZwy-vZJ9LfxIhuXJc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_04-eadbaf270b874af9bb8843b95efe8ca7.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Lastly, UNIGINE’s Heaven Benchmark hit 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees externally on the Razer Blade 15 alone, and dropped to 154 degrees internally and 105 degrees externally when using the C302. All told, this lightweight and affordable pad delivered solid cooling power that helped cut down on both the internal and external temperature of the laptop while under significant stress.</p><p> Depending on test, the results were roughly comparable to or better than more expensive cooling pads, like the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad and Thermaltake Massive TM, which have some added features onboard. It’s also pretty quiet in use—certainly quieter than the Razer Blade 15’s own internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896505/19272" target="_top" id="1896505">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896505" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896505/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-very-affordable"><a href="#Price-It’s-very-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s very affordable"></a>Price: It’s very affordable</h2><p> At $30, this is one of the most affordable laptop cooling pads on the market right now. While results varied across multiple tests and games&#x2F;apps, the C302 was pretty well in line with some of the pricier options I tested. It feels a little flimsy and doesn’t have any premium features, but the C302 is a very good entry-level option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3hXx9Tb9omnQS0YyIXmv97Lunr0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TopMate_C302_02-8fc1ac2169044c0a82b61a80f63ef089.jpg"                      alt="TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#TopMate-C302-vs-Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>TopMate C302 vs. Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> At $27, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a bit more robust. It gives you the ability to power the fans on and off—either the one large fan, or the group of four smaller fans around it—plus it runs a little quieter in use. The unit feels more durable overall, although the Kootek’s height adjustment system feels clunky, as you slide a hanging metal bar into plastic ridges to keep it upright. Kootek’s pad is larger and designed for laptops as large at 17 inches, but if you don’t need the extra size, the TopMate C302 gets the job done for less cash.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An ideal entry-level pick.</strong></p><p> Durability questions aside, the TopMate C302 Laptop Cooling Pad ultimately worked about as well as the other, pricier pads I tested, helping to offset some of the heat generated by a very hot gaming laptop. If you’re concerned about long-term damage or performance degradation from an overheating laptop, the C302 is a cost-efficient way to help keep your notebook from reaching extreme heat peaks.</p><!--

Keep reading for the full product review.</em></p><p> The new MacBook Pro 16-inch M1 is the best laptop Apple has ever produced.</p><p> The combination of terrific display, incredible speed, and stellar battery life make the Pro a must-buy for anyone who depends on their laptop to speed through demanding computing tasks. Of course, this level of performance comes with a high price tag, starting at $2499. The MacBook Pro offers a window into a new kind of computing experience for those who can stomach the hefty price.</p><p> I’ve been using Apple portables ever since the Powerbook 100 was released in 1991. After spending several weeks with the new MacBook Pro, it offers the responsiveness previously associated only with iPads and iPhones, matched with the refined form factor of Apple’s best laptops.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Back-to-the-future"><a href="#Design-Back-to-the-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Back to the future"></a>Design: Back to the future</h2><p> On the surface, the new MacBook Pro doesn’t look radically different from Apple’s previous Pro laptop models. It’s got a similar aluminum case, and the screen is about the same size as the 2019 model.</p><p> However, the tiny details make all the difference in the design of the new MacBook. The Pro just feels nicer than any laptop Apple has ever made in many different ways starting with the incredibly smooth hinge mechanism when you open it up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFndxams3xUoua0_gkYqRycgBdU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/macbook-pro-1-db37ffedba744e8eb2070780c0d8de10.jpg"                      alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M1, 2021)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Sascha Brodsky</p><p> The Pro could be considered a step back in some areas. For one thing, at 0.66 by 14 by 9.8 inches and 4.8 pounds, the MacBook Pro is chunkier and heavier than the model it replaces. This is definitely not a laptop you’ll forget you are carrying in your backpack. On the other hand, the heft of the new MacBook is reassuring and in keeping with its target market of professionals.</p><p> Apple has also gone full circle and replaced the ports it removed in previous iterations of the MacBook. You get a MagSafe connector, headphone jack, SD card slot, HDMI port, and three Thunderbolt 4 ports, which should be enough for almost any user. There’s no USB-A port but most people won’t miss it.</p><h2 id="Keyboard-Precision-is-everything"><a href="#Keyboard-Precision-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="Keyboard: Precision is everything"></a>Keyboard: Precision is everything</h2><p> The joy of using the MacBook Pro really becomes apparent when you start typing on the keyboard. It’s got a scissor key mechanism that feels precise and offers excellent feedback.</p><p> Apple has ditched the Touch Bar, a strip that allows touch access to software functions.</p><p> The Pro has one of the best keyboards I’ve ever used on a laptop. But If I’m going to be picky, I would say that the key resistance is a little too strong, which can lead to finger fatigue during extended typing sessions.</p><p> Just above the keyboard is another area where Apple has decided to go backward. The company has ditched the Touch Bar, a strip that allows touch access to software functions. As someone who used the Touch Bar for several years and never found a use for it, I say good riddance.</p><h2 id="Trackpad-Big-and-bold"><a href="#Trackpad-Big-and-bold" class="headerlink" title="Trackpad: Big and bold"></a>Trackpad: Big and bold</h2><p> There’s nothing not to like about the trackpad on the new MacBook Pro. It’s big and responsive, and you won’t notice it after a while, which is all you need in an input device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tD3rxlw9zH5xufV5ztJIZyrJc3Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/macbook-pro-3-db6300639d8049d1862d0e4f25a35222.jpg"                      alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M1, 2021)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Sascha Brodsky</p><p> The new MacBook’s trackpad works perfectly, which is more than you can about the one on most Windows laptops. I had no trouble flicking the cursor accurately around the screen when spending hours editing documents.</p><h2 id="Display-Bright-and-beautiful"><a href="#Display-Bright-and-beautiful" class="headerlink" title="Display: Bright and beautiful"></a>Display: Bright and beautiful</h2><p> The Pro sports the best display I’ve ever used on any computer and might be a reason to buy this model all by itself. It screams quality.</p><p> Some users might object to the notch carved out at the top of the display, making room for a camera. But I found that I didn’t even notice the gap after using the Pro for a few hours.</p><p> Along with the glorious display, you get a newly redesigned set of speakers with the Pro.</p><p> The display offers Mini-LED technology, which means that the display can turn off in sections, giving you deeper black levels than regular LED displays. You also get ProMotion which means a high refresh rate for a smoother look when you do things like moving the mouse.</p><p> Along with the glorious display, you get a newly redesigned set of speakers with the Pro. The speakers are, in a word, terrific. They offer four woofers, which bang out sufficient bass to make most music sound lively. Movies sound close to theater quality.</p><p> Text looks terrific on the Pro, and I ended up spending time gazing at Word documents just to admire the way words look so crisp and defined. Video playback was equally impressive, with the Mini-LED screen revealing a level of detail that made me want to rewatch my favorite movies. The no-glare coating also works very well, even when using the Pro in direct sunlight.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Sizzling-speed-that-stays-cool"><a href="#Performance-Sizzling-speed-that-stays-cool" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Sizzling speed that stays cool"></a>Performance: Sizzling speed that stays cool</h2><p> The MacBook Pro uses the same cutting-edge M1 chip, designed by Apple, that’s been powering some of the company’s other machines over the past year.</p><p> The new chip makes all the difference. I never thought my old MacBook Pro from 2019 was slow until I started using the new model, and now I can’t try any other computer without thinking how sluggish it is.</p><p> Apps start nearly instantly on the Pro. I have a bad habit of keeping too many browser tabs open while I’m working. But even when I had dozens of tabs open in both the Chrome and Safari web browsers, the Pro didn’t slow down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UM5_acSqOhRJtIaZE3CeAWp45y0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/macbook-pro-2-2be1639ee44f489286cb43a53aaf6454.jpg"                      alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M1, 2021)"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Sascha Brodsky</p><p> For those who want to know the details, the PCMark benchmarking software found the following scores for the MacBook Pro:</p><p> Single Core: 1749</p><p> Multi-Core: 11542</p><p> By way of comparison, here are the results of the same testing software on the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1):</p><p> Single Core: 1720</p><p> Multi-Core: 7552</p><h2 id="Battery-Keeps-on-going-and-going"><a href="#Battery-Keeps-on-going-and-going" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Keeps on going and going"></a>Battery: Keeps on going and going</h2><p> One of the benefits of the new M1 chip is its efficiency. Despite its power, the chip sips energy. The M1 Pro ran for 16 hours on its battery during continuous use, making it the longest-lasting laptop I’ve ever tried.</p><p> There’s a significant practical gain from all this battery life. Essentially you don’t need to worry about bringing along a charger, even for a full day’s work. It’s a liberating feeling not having to worry about juice.</p><p> The M1 Pro ran for 16 hours during continuous use, making it the longest-lasting laptop I’ve ever tried.</p><p> Another nice thing about the efficient M1 chip is the fact that the MacBook runs cool. I’ve used it for dozens of hours, and it never felt more than slightly warm. Contrast that to my 2019 MacBook Pro that used to get so hot I was worried it would catch fire.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Cough-splutter"><a href="#Price-Cough-splutter" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cough, splutter?"></a>Price: Cough, splutter?</h2><p> The big hiccup for most potential users of the MacBook Pro is its high price tag. I’ve been using the lowest-end model, which starts at $2499. You get a 10-Core CPU, 16-Core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD Storage for that price.</p><p> To put that into perspective, you can buy the excellent<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092658" >MacBook Air, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which also has an M1 chip for $999. The Air at that price point comes with an 8 core CPU, 7 core GPU, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD storage.</p><p> I use my MacBook for hours every day for critical tasks, so spending big doesn’t phase me. I plan to keep the new Pro model for years and make sure I have a relatively futureproof setup.</p><p> A less expensive MacBook will be just fine for many users who just need a light work and fun machine. But for anyone who wants arguably the best laptop ever made, only the new MacBook Pro will do.</p><h2 id="MacBook-Pro-M1-2021-vs-MacBook-Air-M1-2020"><a href="#MacBook-Pro-M1-2021-vs-MacBook-Air-M1-2020" class="headerlink" title="MacBook Pro (M1, 2021) vs. MacBook Air (M1, 2020)"></a>MacBook Pro (M1, 2021) vs. MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</h2><p> There’s an excellent case to be made that for many people, the much less expensive MacBook Air is a better option than the Pro model.</p><p> The Air offers many of the same benefits as the Pro, including the screaming fast M1 processor, which also means a very long battery life. You also get the tried and tested portability of the Air model, which makes it significantly slimmer and lighter than the Pro.</p><p> But the Pro model does have many advantages over the air, and it’s a question of deciding whether they are enough for you to pay the extra money. For example, the Pro comes with many ports that can be handy for hooking up peripherals, whereas with the Air, you are pretty much stuck with USB-C.</p><p> The screen of the 16-inch MacBook Pro is also leaps and bounds ahead of the Air model. The Pro display is much larger than the Air, of course, which means that you can see a lot more information at a time and can make working with large documents or spreadsheets easier. The screen also blows away the Air in terms of sharpness and resolution, which you’ll instantly notice if you have the two models side by side.</p><p> If your main computing tasks are light web browsing and you value portability over raw power, the Air is a solid choice. But if you spend many hours a day looking at your laptop’s screen and want the flexibility of lots of ports, you won’t regret spending the extra cash on the Pro.  </p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An incredibly powerful laptop.</strong></p><p> As one of the newest and more expensive laptops on the market, it’s no surprise that I’m giving the MacBook Pro top marks in practice. Blazing speed, a great screen, and all day and then some battery life make this a great laptop for almost any use. However, the design is back to the basics and road warriors might want to consider a lighter, less bulky model. But, if you depend on your MacBook for demanding tasks, this is a must-buy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915830/19272" target="_top" id="1915830">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915830" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915830/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092658" >Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-air-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092793" >Apple MacBook Air 13-inch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-7390-2-in-1-review-5113106" >Dell XPS 13 7390 (2020) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>MPN  MK183LL&#x2F;A</li><li>Release Date  October 2021</li><li>Weight  4.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 in.</li><li>Color  Silver, Space Gray</li><li>Price  Starting at $2,499</li><li>Warranty  1 year (limited)</li><li>Platform  macOS Monterey</li><li>Processor  Apple M1 Pro chip or Apple M1 Max chip, 10-core CPU, up to 32-core GPU</li><li>RAM  Up to 64GB</li><li>Storage  Up to 8TB</li><li>Camera  1080p</li><li>Battery Life  Up to 21 hours</li><li>Ports  3x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), HDMI, SDXC card slot</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/outubes-adsense-income-strategy-calculating-per-thousand-viewers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Youtube's AdSense Income Strategy Calculating Per Thousand Viewers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-amazing-features-of-dells-xps-13-7390-2-in-1-ultrabook-unveiled/"><u>A Deep Dive Into the Amazing Features of Dell's XPS 13 (7390): 2-In-1 Ultrabook Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/achieve-clear-communication-on-zoo-conferencing/"><u>Achieve Clear Communication on Zoo Conferencing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-conscious-caixun-4k-smart-television-a-comprehensive-75-inch-display-review/"><u>Budget-Conscious Caixun 4K Smart Television – A Comprehensive 75-Inch Display Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/deciphering-the-architects-behind-responsible-ai-supervision-roles-and-entities-involved/"><u>Deciphering the Architects Behind Responsible AI Supervision: Roles and Entities Involved</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-pokemon-go-route-not-working-on-zte-nubia-flip-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fix Pokemon Go Route Not Working On ZTE Nubia Flip 5G?

This heavy brick of a portable charger proves to be a handy tool, especially in the car—whether for emergencies or when you need to top up a device while you’re away from home.</p><p> Granted, it doesn’t pack as much power as some dedicated laptop chargers, which may be a better option for that need. Still, the added versatility gives the Halo Bolt a unique edge in the market. I tested the Halo Bolt for a week with multiple devices, including laptops and smartphones.</p><h2 id="Design-The-shiny-brick"><a href="#Design-The-shiny-brick" class="headerlink" title="Design: The shiny brick"></a><strong>Design: The shiny brick</strong></h2><p> While certainly portable, the Halo Bolt isn’t designed to be pocket-friendly. This big brick of a battery pack comes in at 7.2 x 1.6 x 3.8 inches (HWD) with a weight of more than 1.5 pounds. Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.</p><p> It’s made of mostly thick black plastic outside, including a glossy brushed silver top layer with an imprinted Halo logo. The front face is where most of the ports sit, including two USB-A ports (5V&#x2F;2.4A), a DC input for the charging adapter, and jump-start inputs hidden behind a small door. The right side, meanwhile, has the 115V AC&#x2F;65W max AC power plug input for laptop chargers and other plug-in devices.</p><p> Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.</p><p> Each set of inputs has a power button to activate the ports, and you can use the AC input and USB ports simultaneously, but the Jump Starter can only function independently. Meanwhile, the left side of the device has a bright built-in LED flashlight with a power button, giving you another handy tool during car emergencies.</p><p> The Halo Bolt also comes with an array of accessories, including a wall charging adapter, a car charging adapter, jumper cables, a USB-to-micro USB cable, and a cinching pouch for quick storage of all the above. All of the cables and accessories are a welcome bonus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nYYltjJN71EGK1Dwv2_XABixuhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-04-85b590a9939a4f44b0c7a510a456b80f.jpg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105873/7443" target="_top" id="2105873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Load-it-up"><a href="#Setup-Process-Load-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Load it up"></a><strong>Setup Process: Load it up</strong></h2><p> You’ll need to charge the brick to total capacity before using it, and the four green battery lights on the right side of the front face indicate how much capacity is currently left. The battery is fully charged when all four are illuminated when pressing any of the power buttons. Otherwise, for the AC and USB ports, the Halo Bolt is a plug-and-play charger.</p><p> The whole process for jump-starting a car is detailed in the included instructions. The Halo Bolt has built-in safety features that ensure you have correctly aligned the jumper cables before starting the connected car, boat, lawnmower, or other vehicles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mUdXUjWxeupVqNR_y43_eFTC0ic=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-02-69b93dc934684ef5b71a40215f6162f2.jpg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting</strong></h2><p> The Halo Bolt has 58,830mWh of battery power within, and the official description suggests that it can provide up to several hours of additional usage for a MacBook Pro or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-4688969" >iPad Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In my testing, the results didn’t quite match those targets.</p><p> Plugging in a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >mid-2019 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge. It went from 0 percent to 88 percent in 1 hour and 30 minutes, at a maximum recorded charging rate of 58.29W (20.1V&#x2F;1.9A).</p><p> In a separate test, I played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at 100 percent brightness on the laptop, with the Halo Bolt plugged in to sustain the laptop’s fully-charged battery. The Halo Bolt provided power to the computer for 5 hours, 14 minutes before running out of battery, but that’s a fair bit less than the Mophie Powerstation AC (6 hours, 22 minutes) and ZMI PowerPort 20000 (8 hours, 4 minutes) in the same test.</p><p> Plugging in a mid-2019 MacBook Pro (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge.</p><p> Not having a USB-C Power Delivery port on the Halo Bolt is disappointing, as many modern devices rely on the standard for speedy charging. You’ll need to bring your own AC adapters to plug into the AC port to get maximum speeds.</p><p> For example, charging a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone using one of the Halo Bolt’s USB-A ports took 2 hours and 56 minutes to complete at a paltry 5.19W (4.76V x 1.09A), starting from 0 percent. However, when I repeated the test using Samsung’s charger via the AC port, it finished in 1 hour and 34 minutes thanks to fast charging—nearly half the total time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MNFqifirQ0sn61GPO1e-bLQ1t8s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-06-8bc3449bd35243aaaf67272c1d3774a6-bc803e0a114b4116adf3078af6a2de00.jpeg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983552">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983552">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983552%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983552/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-priced-right"><a href="#Price-It’s-priced-right" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s priced right"></a><strong>Price: It’s priced right</strong></h2><p> For a jack-of-all-trades power brick that can jump-start your car and charge its battery, serve as a bright flashlight for roadside emergencies, and charge a wide array of portable devices, the $100 price seen on Amazon looks pretty reasonable. However, given that it couldn’t charge my laptop to total capacity and lacks a USB-C port, handier, higher-capacity charging bricks are available specifically for laptop and smartphone charging needs.</p><h2 id="Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000"><a href="#Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000" class="headerlink" title="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000"></a><strong>Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000</strong></h2><p> Here’s a prime example. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/zmi-powerpack-20000-review-5071991" >ZMI PowerPack 20000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BD98CM?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5071993%7Cn35698be70c304b229c7a194255ab2d3620%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have an AC port. However, it’s pocket-friendly, packs a lot of capacity (20,000mAh), and can quickly recharge laptops with its included USB-C port. It also has two USB-A ports and sufficient juice to recharge the same MacBook Pro from empty. Best of all, it only costs $70.</p><p> But that smaller, cheaper power brick is only meant for portable devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and handheld game systems. It has no jump-start capabilities nor an AC port to accommodate a wider array of devices.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Final Verdict: A convenient backup battery and jump starter.</strong></p><p> The Halo Bolt isn’t the best option for charging laptops, but it is a solid all-around device for providing backup power to a broader array of gadgets, not to mention jump-starting a car. This versatile device is smart to have around if you drive a car and are frequently mobile with your portable gadgets. I wouldn’t bring it with me on vacation, but it could prove useful before long as a backup device to keep handy.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Bolt ACDC 58830 mWh Portable Charger&#x2F;Jump Starter</li><li>Product Brand  Halo</li><li>SKU  811279030120</li><li>Price  $100.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.2 x 3.8 x 1.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  90 Days</li><li>Ports  2x USB-A. 1x AC, 1x Jump Start</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-legacy-of-memories-scanning-and-storing-vintage-photographs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Legacy of Memories Scanning and Storing Vintage Photographs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-next-gen-platform-for-12-hourly-live-broadcasts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Next-Gen Platform for 12 Hourly Live Broadcasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-commercial-cloud-repository-standouts/"><u>2024 Approved Commercial Cloud Repository Standouts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-setup-for-high-quality-video-transmission/"><u>2024 Approved Expert Setup for High-Quality Video Transmission</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-best-7-color-grades-in-editing/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide Best 7 Color Grades in Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-your-audio-cues-with-ease-windows-and-os-x-guide-to-srt/"><u>2024 Approved Unlock Your Audio Cues with Ease Windows & OS X Guide to SRT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/discover-why-the-sumind-bt70b-is-tops-amongst-bluetooth-fm-transmitters-a-review-worth-reading/"><u>Discover Why the Sumind BT70B Is Tops Amongst Bluetooth FM Transmitters: A Review Worth Reading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/expert-review-of-the-havit-5-portable-laptop-cooler-with-five-speed-settings/"><u>Expert Review of the HAVIT 5 Portable Laptop Cooler with Five Speed Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/24-how-much-can-you-earn-on-youtube-via-ad-revenue/"><u>In 2024, How Much Can You Earn on YouTube via Ad Revenue?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-instagrams-peak-performance-with-these-top-8-planning-tools/"><u>In 2024, Instagram's Peak Performance with These Top 8 Planning Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/revealing-the-latest-apc-back-ups-be600m1-test-results-powerful-usb-charging-and-robust-battery-support/"><u>Revealing the Latest APC Back-UPS BE600M1 Test Results - Powerful USB Charging & Robust Battery Support</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/score-amazing-deals-on-benq-projectors-and-displays-for-prime-day-shopping/"><u>Score Amazing Deals on BenQ Projectors & Displays for Prime Day Shopping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-future-of-smartwatches-a-detailed-analysis-of-the-mobvoi-ticwatch-pros-4g-capabilities/"><u>The Future of Smartwatches: A Detailed Analysis of the Mobvoi Ticwatch Pro's 4G Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/cience-of-scheduling-your-best-view-days-for-2024/"><u>The Science of Scheduling Your Best-View Days for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-tech-gadget-review-poweradds-pilot-pro2-superior-charge-for-laptops-and-more/"><u>The Ultimate Tech Gadget Review: POWERADD's Pilot Pro2 - Superior Charge for Laptops and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-capabilities-of-tp-links-ac1200-re305-range-enhancer-a-thorough-review/"><u>Unveiling the Capabilities of TP-Link's AC1200 RE305 Range Enhancer: A Thorough Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Experience-Personalized-Typing-with-the-Latest-Cooler-Master-MK770-Custom-Mechanic-Board-Launch"><a href="#Experience-Personalized-Typing-with-the-Latest-Cooler-Master-MK770-Custom-Mechanic-Board-Launch" class="headerlink" title="Experience Personalized Typing with the Latest Cooler Master MK770 Custom Mechanic Board Launch"></a>Experience Personalized Typing with the Latest Cooler Master MK770 Custom Mechanic Board Launch</h2><p>Cooler Master just launched the <a class="link"   href="http://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Mechanical-Hot-Swappable-MK-770-MCKW1-US/dp/B0CTN2VFCD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002144&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/cooler-master-launches-the-customizable-mk770-mechanical-keyboard/&asc_campaign=Short-Term" >MK770 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a highly customizable mechanical keyboard with a unique sense of style. The MK770 should appeal to both casual users and enthusiasts, as it focuses on comfort without sacrificing high-end features, such as hot-swappable switches and per-key lighting.</p><p> On paper, the MK770 seems to be an exceptional value. It costs just $120 but offers a gasket-mounted design that should provide a “clean” sound. Hallmarks like hot-swappable switches, per-key RGB lighting, and PBT double-shot keycaps are also included. However, the preinstalled Kailh Box V2 switches (White, Red, or) Brown should be perfect for most customers, and Cooler Master’s colorful keycaps already look perfect in the MK770’s chassis.</p><p> Cooler Master also boasts a “hybrid” design that delivers “minimal lag and low power consumption.” That’s a roundabout way of saying that the MK770 includes a 2.4GHz wireless dongle. Connecting with the dongle gives you a 1000Hz polling rate and an extended battery life, though you’re free to use Bluetooth if you want a 125Hz polling rate and increased power consumption. A wired connection can also be facilitated using the included USB-C cable, which is both coiled and braided.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/30.jpg"                      alt="The Cooler Master MK770 keyboard in Space Gray and Macaron colorways."                > </p><p>Cooler Master</p><p> While this isn’t a “portable” keyboard, it uses a semi-compact 96% layout that should free up some space on your desk. The 96% key layout omits some unessential keys and features a condensed numpad area. In this case, the omitted keys are Prt Sc, Pause, Scroll Lock, Home, and End.</p><p> The lack of a Prt Sc key is somewhat frustrating for Windows users. Thankfully, you can use the Win + Shift + S keyboard shortcut to take screenshots with the Snipping Tool, or simply remap Prt Sc to a key that you don’t need.</p><p> You can build macros or remap the MK770’s keys in a third-party tool like SharpKeys or <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-add-music-in-premiere-pro/" >PowerToys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But you’ll probably want to use the MasterPlus software, as it allows you to store up to three custom profiles in the MK770 keyboard’s memory. These profiles can be recalled using a simple keyboard shortcut and may be useful when jumping between devices or transitioning from work to play.</p><p> The MK770 comes in two colorways—the bold blue “Macaron” and the more subdued “Space Gray.” You can purchase the keyboard for $120 at <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Mechanical-Hot-Swappable-MK-770-MCKW1-US/dp/B0CTN2VFCD/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002144&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/cooler-master-launches-the-customizable-mk770-mechanical-keyboard/&asc_campaign=Short-Term" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the <a class="link"   href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/peripheral/keyboards/mk770/" >Cooler Master web store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Source: Cooler Master</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-capture-your-sounds-on-pc-with-x-recorder-for-2024/"><u>[New] Capture Your Sounds on PC with X-Recorder for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-green-thumbs-up-the-best-farming-titles-for-group-playtime-for-2024/"><u>[New] Green Thumbs Up The Best Farming Titles for Group Playtime for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-the-art-of-flipping-photo-shades/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling the Art of Flipping Photo Shades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-quick-and-simple-ipad-conversion-turn-jpgpng-into-pdf/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Quick and Simple iPad Conversion Turn JPG/PNG Into PDF</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-apply-these-techniques-to-improve-how-to-detect-fake-gps-location-on-tecno-spark-10-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Apply These Techniques to Improve How to Detect Fake GPS Location On Tecno Spark 10 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ditch-final-cut-pro-x-10-free-and-paid-alternatives-to-consider/"><u>New In 2024, Ditch Final Cut Pro X? 10 Free and Paid Alternatives to Consider</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/no-more-quick-yt-thumbnails-full-length-viewing/"><u>No More Quick YT Thumbnails Full-Length Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-acer-purchases-on-prime-day-2024-unbeatable-discounts/"><u>Top Acer Purchases on Prime Day 2024: Unbeatable Discounts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-wi-fi-signal-boosters-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>Top Rated Wi-Fi Signal Boosters : A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-retro-bluetooth-fm-transmitter-unveiled-a-complete-guide-to-the-nulaxy-km18-model/"><u>Top-Rated Retro Bluetooth FM Transmitter Unveiled: A Complete Guide to the Nulaxy KM18 Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-ring-video-doorbell-2-why-its-top-notch/"><u>Ultimate Guide to the Ring Video Doorbell 2: Why It's Top-Notch!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-test-asus-rog-rapture-gt-ax11000-for-gamers-experience-pinnacle-speed-and-features/"><u>Ultimate Test: Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX11000 for Gamers - Experience Pinnacle Speed & Features</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144299/7443" target="_top" id="2144299">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144299" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144299/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump is a portable tire inflator that’s budget-friendly, convenient, and discreet. You can expect it to perform reliably and efficiently whenever you pull it out of your trunk. It’s not only a good just-in-case device for unexpected flats, but also for regular pressure maintenance so you get the most out of your tires. It loses some points for subpar instructions, but the pump is so intuitive that it shouldn’t matter. For the price, there’s not much to complain about.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100537/7443" target="_top" id="2100537">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100537" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100537/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Easy-enough-for-anyone"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Easy-enough-for-anyone" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Easy enough for anyone"></a><strong>Design and Features: Easy enough for anyone</strong></h2><p> The most convenient thing about the Audew portable air compressor is that all its essential components are integrated into one unit. Hose, compressor, and power cord are all together and assembled. All you have to do is connect it to power and then a tire.</p><p> This portable tire inflator has a unique triangular design. The heavy-duty plastic case is mostly black with bright yellow accents. This makes it easy to spot during daylight hours and the yellow trim makes it a bit more visible at night.</p><p> The LED bulb is quite small and isn’t very bright. You should only expect to illuminate only a few inches directly in front of the device.</p><p> The built-in LED light provides enhanced visibility for the device itself and for the tire or object you’re inflating. However, the bulb is quite small and isn’t very bright. You should only expect to illuminate only a few inches directly in front of you.</p><p> When it isn’t in use, the 21-inch air-hose wraps around the edge of the triangular casing, and the nozzle fits nicely in its notch, locking the cord in place, which makes it more compact and convenient to store. The 10-foot power cord and attached 12V adapter fit snugly, if imperfectly, on the back.</p><p> However, don’t expect to fit the entire cord in the provided grooves, they’re simply not enough room. A portion of the cord will always be hanging out of the side. But once it’s in the carrying case, that visual foible doesn’t matter.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> control panel is a simple affair. You get three buttons and a small LED display. Once you have it plugged in and attached to your tire, simply set the PSI level (pounds per square inch) you want, hit the R button and the pump immediately goes to work. When the desired PSI level is reached, the pump automatically shuts down to prevent overfill.</p><p> This tire pump can inflate tires and other objects up to 150 PSI. You’ll rarely, if ever, need to pump something that tight but it’s nice to know that you can. Generally speaking, tires on a sedan should be filled between 30 to 32 PSI. Check your car’s owner’s manual for your model’s specific needs.</p><p> In addition to PSI, this mini tire pump also displays pressure in the metric system’s BAR and KPA units. This is useful if you intend to use the device outside of the US or use it with products that measure pressure using the metric or SI system.</p><p> This portable air compressor draws power from<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V “cigarette lighter” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> adapter attached to the power cord. This makes it convenient for use with a vehicle, but also limits its usefulness for situations where a vehicle with the proper socket isn’t available.</p><p> This tire pump can inflate tires and other objects up to 150 PSI. You’ll rarely, if ever, need to pump something that tight but it’s nice to know that you can.</p><p> Audew includes a discreet, black carrying case with this portable car pump. It’s a compact 9.2 x 8.3 x 4.3 inches (HWD), square and fits easily in your trunk, garage shelves or wherever you keep just-in-case items such as jumper cables and flashlights.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Language-Barriers-Overcome-with-Simplicity"><a href="#Setup-Process-Language-Barriers-Overcome-with-Simplicity" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Language Barriers Overcome with Simplicity"></a><strong>Setup Process: Language Barriers Overcome with Simplicity</strong></h2><p> Despite the Audew being so intuitive and straightforward, you’ll definitely want to take at least a few minutes to familiarize yourself with it because it has a few foibles. The most notable stumbling block is the instruction manual and warranty card. It is printed in, at best, broken English. The instructions themselves are brief and only cover the most basic aspects of the device. Fortunately, the air compressor is intuitive enough to grasp after only a few minutes, but you definitely want those minutes to be spent in your driveway. However, once you have a good grasp of it, you should be able to take the Audew portable air compressor out, hook it up, and get it running in less than a minute.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012429/19272" target="_top" id="2012429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012429/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Fast-filling-for-the-road"><a href="#Performance-Fast-filling-for-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Fast filling for the road"></a><strong>Performance: Fast filling for the road</strong></h2><p> To put the portable tire inflator through its paces, we took it road tripping through the American Mountain West for several days. We stopped at gas stations and rest stops along the way to simulate real-life situations where you’d be using it on the go.</p><p> You can operate the pump for about eight minutes at a time before it has to power down and rest for three minutes.</p><p> Our first test involved deflating all four tires on our car to 20 PSI (the point where they’re considered dangerously low), and timing how long it took to inflate them to the recommended 32 PSI. On average, it took the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump just over one minute to complete this task. This is pretty quick, only one other portable air compressor we tested had a faster average fill time.</p><p> You can operate the pump for about eight minutes at a time before it has to power down and rest for three minutes. However, throughout our week of testing portable tire pumps, we never had to run it that long to fill a tire. To hit eight minutes of continuous use, you’d have to be inflating something like a large swimming pool or a bouncy castle.</p><p> To test the accuracy of this pump, we routinely checked the air pressure displayed on the screen with that of a simple stick tire pressure gauge. Their readings consistently came within 1 PSI of each other. So while you can trust its accuracy, you can’t throw your pressure gauge out since the pump isn’t very convenient or quick for measuring tire pressure.</p><p> When in use, the loudest it got was 99 decibels, generally hovering around 97-98 decibels. For comparison, an average conversation is about 60 decibels.</p><p> We also used a decibel meter to measure how loud the pump got. When in use, the loudest it got was 99 decibels, generally hovering around 97-98 decibels. For comparison, an average conversation is about 60 decibels. So, while it probably won’t wake the neighbors or cause hearing damage, don’t expect to have a particularly intelligible conversation while it’s running.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Price-Great-for-budget-hawks"><a href="#Price-Great-for-budget-hawks" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for budget hawks"></a><strong>Price: Great for budget hawks</strong></h2><p> The list price for the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump is about $32 on Amazon, making it one of the most budget-friendly portable tire inflators out there. However, if you shop around, it’s very easy to find it cheaper, making it an even more attractive deal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915810/19272" target="_top" id="1915810">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915810" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915810/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audew-Portable-Air-Compressor-Pump-vs-Jaco-SmartPro-Digital-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Audew-Portable-Air-Compressor-Pump-vs-Jaco-SmartPro-Digital-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump vs. Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump vs. Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> If you’re willing to spend a little extra money on your portable air compressor, the Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator has many of the benefits of the Audew, with some enhancements thrown in.</p><p> The Jaco’s is about as small as the Audew. Its rectangular design includes superior air hose and power cord storage—they actually fit in their compartments. Additionally, the built-in LED light seems bright as a lighthouse compared to the small bulb in the Audew. More importantly, the Jaco SmartPro inflator can run continually for half an hour before you have to cycle down and rest, much better than the mere eight minutes you get with the Audew.</p><p> If you’re on a budget, there’s nothing wrong with the Audew. But the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator offers a better set of features for the price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jaco-smartpro-digital-tire-inflator-review-4776811" >Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A simple, easy to use pump for your tires.</strong></p><p> The Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump has a lot going for it. It’s simple to operate, fills your tires quickly, and has an inexpensive price tag. It’s a basic device with a couple of quirks, but they’re easy to get past. If your goal is to be prepared for an unexpected flat or perform routine tire pressure maintenance, this pump is a cheap and reliable way to do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983539%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983539/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Portable Air Compressor Pump</li><li>Product Brand  Audew</li><li>UPC  X001ETBXFD</li><li>Price  $31.99</li><li>Release Date  May 2017</li><li>Weight  2.65 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  9.2 x 8.3 x 4.3 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 Year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-how-to-make-instagram-highlight-covers/"><u>[New] How to Make Instagram Highlight Covers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-capture-and-share-saving-your-ppt-sessions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Capture and Share Saving Your PPT Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-erasing-extra-borders-for-smooth-youtube-playback/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Erasing Extra Borders for Smooth YouTube Playback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-approaches-to-video-voiceover-integration/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Approaches to Video Voiceover Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/a-guide-realme-12-proplus-5g-wireless-and-wired-screen-mirroring-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Guide Realme 12 Pro+ 5G Wireless and Wired Screen Mirroring | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordability-and-performance-the-ultimate-tp-link-archer-c9-review/"><u>Affordability and Performance: The Ultimate TP-Link Archer C9 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-analysis-unveiling-the-ultimate-speedy-media-streamer/"><u>Amazon Fire TV Cube Analysis: Unveiling the Ultimate Speedy Media Streamer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-review-of-the-nintendo-switch-mastering-mobile-play/"><u>Comprehensive Review of the Nintendo Switch: Mastering Mobile Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/converti-file-m4r-su-aac-gratuitamente-online-con-movavi/"><u>Converti File .m4r Su AAC Gratuitamente Online Con Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ddpai-mini3-dash-cam-revealed-an-unexpectedly-entertaining-experience/"><u>DDpai Mini3 Dash Cam Revealed: An Unexpectedly Entertaining Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/discover-exceptional-value-the-lenovo-tab-m10-fhdplus-2020-review-spectacular-screen-unbeatable-budget/"><u>Discover Exceptional Value: The Lenovo Tab M10 FHD+ (2020) Review -

The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186864/12108" target="_top" id="1186864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186864/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C2UBXNFmxG8nA0udy1IprMH4LBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_9_Final_Horiz-1af52951f8704af9b76d7dd1ec9744a9.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive HD camera"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive HD camera</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost.

Understandably, plenty of gamers have voiced dissatisfaction with this trend, but not only does this make perfect sense for publishers, it’s actually good for players too.</p><h2 id="It-Means-a-Single-Stock-Pool-for-All-Platforms"><a href="#It-Means-a-Single-Stock-Pool-for-All-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="It Means a Single Stock Pool for All Platforms"></a>It Means a Single Stock Pool for All Platforms</h2><p> I clearly remembered how badly I wanted the ultimate collector’s edition of <em>Borderlands 2</em> for my PlayStation 3. This beauty came with a ton of cool items, but most of all I wanted that replica of an in-game loot chest. Despite pre-ordering, my order was canceled due to stock issues, but I could still have the Xbox 360 version. The only problem was that I didn’t have an Xbox 360.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/borderlands-ultimate-loot-chest-collection.jpg"                      alt="Borderlands Ultimate Loot Chest collection"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049369/7443" target="_top" id="2049369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049369/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Gearbox Entertainment</p><p> Now, you can argue that if I had infinite money I could just have bought the wrong edition and the regular game for my console, but having a single version of the collector’s edition that isn’t platform specific would have solved this issue. Not only does it mean that all platforms draw from the same pool of stock, it also means that these editions can be cheaper to make because you have economies of scale that apply to just one product, rather than being split over three or four versions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Physical-and-Digital-Players-Can-Both-Buy-the-Same-Edition"><a href="#Physical-and-Digital-Players-Can-Both-Buy-the-Same-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Physical and Digital Players Can Both Buy the Same Edition"></a>Physical and Digital Players Can Both Buy the Same Edition</h2><p> If you prefer, as most people do, to have a digital version of a game, then including a copy of the game in the collector’s edition makes it less attractive. I think leaving the disc out is a good compromise that caters to the majority of gamers (who are no digital) and those who still want physical media. Pick whichever game format or version you want, and then pick up the collector’s edition of the game alongside it.</p><p> After all, whether you’re a digital or physical game media supporter, that doesn’t make you more or less likely to want a cool statue or T-shirt. Personally I think the overwhelming shift to digital game distribution was one of the main factors driving the trend of not including the game with collector’s editions, but either way it’s a net benefit for both types of player.</p><h2 id="It-Means-PC-Gamers-Can-Get-In-on-the-Action"><a href="#It-Means-PC-Gamers-Can-Get-In-on-the-Action" class="headerlink" title="It Means PC Gamers Can Get In on the Action"></a>It Means PC Gamers Can Get In on the Action</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/53487822647_b3c12b8c9e_o.jpg"                      alt="NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU inside a gaming PC."                > </p><p>Justin Duino &#x2F; How-To Geek</p><p> Almost all fancy collector’s editions are aimed at console gamers, or at least they have been in the past. Since physical gaming has been dead on PC for years now, this meant buying a console copy of a multiplatform game you’ll never use. It’s perhaps a small concession, but by leaving the game out of the collector’s edition, PC gamers don’t have to be second-class citizens.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Better-Quality-Swag"><a href="#Better-Quality-Swag" class="headerlink" title="Better Quality Swag"></a>Better Quality Swag</h2><p> Let’s be honest, a lot of these collector’s editions in the past have included stuff that was frankly nicer on paper than in-hand. Since the price of the game has to be factored into the overall price of the collectors’ edition, it means there’s less money in the budget for the actual goodies. There is, after all, a limit to how high you can make the price overall. I wouldn’t go as far as saying this is always true, but by focusing the entire budget of the collector’s edition on the goodies and not the game, you’re more likely to get something that’s not garbage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087485/7443" target="_top" id="2087485">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087485" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087485/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-Can-Buy-the-Game-Later"><a href="#You-Can-Buy-the-Game-Later" class="headerlink" title="You Can Buy the Game Later"></a>You Can Buy the Game Later</h2><p> I’ve argued in the past that the <a class="link"   href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/voice-chat-malfunction-solved-steps-to-reconnect-and-communicate-effectively-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/" >worst time to buy a game is when it releases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and there’s <a class="link"   href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-striding-forward-a-comprehensive-review-of-vr-walkers/" >no point in pre-ordering <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> purely digital games since the supply is effectively infinite. That’s not the case for a collectors’ edition of a game, which has a fixed physical number of units. In most cases there won’t be a second production run either so if you miss your chance, that’s it. Being scalped on Ebay is your only other option.</p><p> With discless collectors’ editions you can pre-order the goodies, and leave buying the game until the first few patches have released. If you’re truly patient, you can wait for the definite patched version to be released on disc. I understand the FOMO of wanting to play that game the instant it releases, but at least these discless editions let you split the commitment between the physical goodies and the game itself.</p><h2 id="Collector’s-Editions-Are-Truly-Optional"><a href="#Collector’s-Editions-Are-Truly-Optional" class="headerlink" title="Collector’s Editions Are Truly Optional"></a>Collector’s Editions Are Truly Optional</h2><p> Whether having a collectors’ edition of a game that doesn’t include the actual game is an issue, is all a matter of perspective. You aren’t buying these editions to save money, you’re buying them because you’re a superfan. You were going to buy the game anyway, so what does it matter that the collectors’ edition stuff is a separate purchase from the game itself?</p><p> As far as I can see, there’s no real downside to this, and most of the time there’s a special steel-case or some other nice way to store the physical disc included in the kit anyway. In which case (ha!) physical game collector’s don’t really have much to complain about either. Certainly having this completely optional add-on to your game purchase is a good sight better than the trend of having three, four, or even five different digital editions all separated by tiny difference in bonus content. There’s plenty to legitimately complain about in the gaming hobby, but this particular issue doesn’t seem like a worthy example in my opinion.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-snicker-snapshots-jokeframe/"><u>[New] Snicker Snapshots JokeFrame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-god-of-war-ragnarok-release-date-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] God of War Ragnarok Release Date for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/download-the-official-hp-officejet-pro-8740-drivers-compatible-with-windows-11-10-and-8/"><u>Download the Official HP OfficeJet Pro 8740 Drivers Compatible with Windows 11, 10 & 8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-contacts-from-150-2023-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to recover deleted contacts from 150 (2023).</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-win11s-premier-selection-of-videography-software/"><u>In 2024, Win11's Premier Selection of Videography Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-mobility-ranking-the-top-8-most-engaging-mobile-games/"><u>Mastering Mobility: Ranking the Top 8 Most Engaging Mobile Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-novice-to-pro-3-easy-game-recording-options/"><u>New 2024 Approved From Novice to Pro 3 Easy Game Recording Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/oneplus-9-pro-evaluation-exquisite-aesthetics-blazing-fast-processor-and-innovative-photographic-capabilities/"><u>OnePlus 9 Pro Evaluation: Exquisite Aesthetics, Blazing Fast Processor & Innovative Photographic Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/oodle-where-free-local-offers-await-you-in-our-marketplace-classifieds/"><u>Oodle: Where Free Local Offers Await You in Our Marketplace Classifieds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/1722992319592-overcoming-blackout-challenges-in-magic-the-gathering-digital-platform-guide-completed/"><u>Overcoming Blackout Challenges in Magic: The Gathering Digital Platform – Guide Completed!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/patch-or-upgrade-decoding-software-evolutions/"><u>Patch or Upgrade: Decoding Software Evolutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/pioneer-kids-waterproof-capture-set-reviewed/"><u>Pioneer Kids Waterproof Capture Set Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/power-up-your-day-with-the-mighty-beatit-bt-d11-jump-starter-reviewed/"><u>Power Up Your Day with the Mighty Beatit BT-D11 Jump Starter Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/redefining-mobility-expert-insights-on-the-new-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano/"><u>Redefining Mobility: Expert Insights on the New Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/step-into-a-world-apart-from-the-fallout-show/"><u>Step Into a World Apart From the Fallout Show</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Latency causes lag and matters most for gaming, so don’t pick the “fastest” internet connection type based purely on speed alone.</li><li>DSL, fixed wireless, and satellite internet are often the only options for rural areas.</li><li>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite from Starlink offers competitive pricing, higher bandwidth, and lower latency compared to Hughesnet and Viasat.</li></ul><p> After eagerly awaiting the release of a new multiplayer title (and using streaming service Amazon Luna to play it), I immediately remembered the horrors of online gaming in a rural area. With that began the search for a better rural internet provider.</p><h2 id="What’s-Slowing-Us-Down"><a href="#What’s-Slowing-Us-Down" class="headerlink" title="What’s Slowing Us Down?"></a>What’s Slowing Us Down?</h2><p> When advertising internet speeds, providers will list bandwidth as a gauge for overall speed. However, this only tells us the amount of data that can potentially be transferred per second. <a class="link"   href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-crafting-cinematic-magic-essential-tips-for-creating-stunning-slow-motion-media-on-instagram/" >The other half of determining internet speed is latency <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> Latency is a measure of how long it takes for a signal or package of data to travel from a transmitting device such as your PC or console to the intended receiver like your router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cloudflare_result.jpg"                      alt="The results of an internet speed test, with latency highlighted,"                > </p><p> To put it in more practical terms, when you’re in a game and want your character to move forward, the amount of time between sending the request and seeing the action performed is the latency. This number is what gamers refer to as “ping.” The higher the latency, the more <a class="link"   href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-record-hulu-on-all-platforms-winmacmobile/" >lag you’ll experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Satellite-Saves-the-Day…-Almost"><a href="#Satellite-Saves-the-Day…-Almost" class="headerlink" title="Satellite Saves the Day… Almost"></a>Satellite Saves the Day… Almost</h2><p> Since high latency is a network problem rather than a hardware problem, upgrading your home equipment won’t improve your experience much if at all. This is why the type of internet connection you have is so important.</p><p> The best connections currently available are fiber optic, 5G, and cable internet. Unfortunately, these are rarely viable options in rural areas. For most companies, the cost of equipment like towers and ground wires along with the dangerous installation conditions hasn’t been worth the risk when compared to the rate of demand. That leaves rural gamers with DSL, fixed wireless, or satellite internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-10-095123.png"                      alt="A screenshot showing Google Fiber is unavailable in the area"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Of the three, DSL is both the best and worst option available in remote areas. Much like dial-up, DSL uses existing home phone lines to connect users to the internet over copper wire. DSL is much quicker than dial-up, and those who use a wired home phone won’t have to choose between gaming or taking a call.</p><p> The downside of DSL is that, because the copper telephone wires are very long, the data signal can be easily weakened, making for unreliable connections. DSL is also slowly being phased out due to decreased demand.</p><p> With fixed wireless internet, radio waves are transmitted between an antenna installed on or near your house and your provider’s cell tower. This option is known to provide speeds comparable to cable internet as long as your antenna has a clear view of the provider’s tower.</p><p> Due to a lack of towers among providers, fixed wireless isn’t widely available in rural areas despite being intended for these users. T-Mobile and Verizon are starting to use their large network of cell towers to help fix this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/shutterstock_1838922316.jpg"                      alt="A cell tower over rural West Virginia."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148645/16836" target="_top" id="2148645">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148645" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148645/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/aerial-view-mobiel-phone-cell-tower-1838922316" >Steve Heap&#x2F;Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> That leaves us with our final, and most likely available option: satellite. In this type of network, after a signal is sent from your device to your <a class="link"   href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-id-locked-or-disabled-from-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-7-mehtods-you-cant-miss-by-drfone-ios/" >router and modem <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is transmitted by your home satellite to your provider’s satellites in space.</p><p> From there, the signal is transmitted to the satellites at your provider’s ground hub and received by their servers. Because of the equipment involved and the long distances the pings have to travel, satellite internet is often the most expensive option, despite being the slowest and least reliable.</p><h2 id="Which-Provider-Is-Right-for-You"><a href="#Which-Provider-Is-Right-for-You" class="headerlink" title="Which Provider Is Right for You?"></a>Which Provider Is Right for You?</h2><p> In my particular case, satellite is the only available internet connection, even though I live a brief 10 minutes from the closest major city. Two of the most well-known and longest-standing providers in the U.S. are Hughesnet and Viasat. In 2020, <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/best-9-free-youtube-logo-makers/" >Starlink made its debut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the first round of public beta testing and has since become the top contender for satellite internet globally.</p><p> What sets Starlink apart from its competitors is that it <a class="link"   href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-first-steps-in-virtual-conferencing-with-zoom/" >employs a constellation of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This greatly reduces latency, thus addressing the main issue of satellite internet. Additionally, Starlink provides higher bandwidth speeds than either company and has mobile options for nomads on land and at sea. Because Starlink has close ties with SpaceX, they are also able to update their satellites more frequently and at a lower cost to the company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-10-102132.png"                      alt="Starlink service plans with equipment costs."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043638/7443" target="_top" id="2043638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043638/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> It would be easy to assume that Starlink is the most expensive option, but when comparing services, this isn’t actually the case. Starlink’s residential plan will cost you $120 per month for unlimited data, and the basic equipment kit can be bought for a one-time payment of $499. Customers in regions with more coverage will also receive a $200 equipment discount.</p><p> Hughesnet’s Fusion tier (the only package with support for online multiplayer gaming) also costs $120 per month. However, customers only get 200GB of priority data each month with unlimited standard data after that. Additionally, the equipment costs $650 or can be rented for an extra $19 per month. The Fusion tier is also limited to certain areas since it is a hybrid of satellite and fixed wireless connections, meaning customers must still be close enough to a Hughesnet tower.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-10-143422.png"                      alt="Hughesnet service plans and current discounts."                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484940/16446" target="_top" id="1484940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484940/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Surprisingly, Viasat is the most expensive satellite option when you look at what you (don’t) get. The unlimited plan is $99 per month and only provides slightly faster bandwidth than Hughesnet’s basic plan which is $75 per month. And though the equipment is cheaper at $15 per month or $250 for their “Lifetime Lease”, installation can cost you up to $500.</p><p> In contrast, Hughesnet provides free installation, and Starlink customers can install their own equipment by following a simple, two-step process. Additionally, Viasat’s unlimited plan doesn’t support any type of online gaming.</p><h2 id="Fix-Your-Wi-Fi-Network-Too"><a href="#Fix-Your-Wi-Fi-Network-Too" class="headerlink" title="Fix Your Wi-Fi Network Too"></a>Fix Your Wi-Fi Network Too</h2><p> While having the latest home equipment won’t fix latency issues, there are other ways you can optimize your home network. First and foremost, you’ll want to make sure your router is at least <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2023-play-facebook-videos-on-tv-for-2024/" >up to date <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-ways-to-trade-pokemon-go-from-far-away-on-nokia-130-music-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/" >strategically placed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Hiding it in the entertainment stand may be aesthetically pleasing, but it can greatly hinder your Wi-Fi signal.</p><p> Secondly, anything that needs a high-speed connection should be connected via an Ethernet cable. If it is not possible to connect directly to your modem, consider switching to a mesh network which <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/manipulating-media-with-mastery-tools/" >uses a series of interconnected nodes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to improve home Wi-Fi coverage. Be sure to check that the nodes provided with the system you choose <a class="link"   href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleashing-new-worlds-best-psvr-games-on-their-way-out/" >have Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Mesh systems can also help if <a class="link"   href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleash-creativity-exquisite-text-effects-for-adobes-affects/" >any of these common things <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are blocking your Wi-Fi signal.</p><hr><p> It’s important to keep in mind that certain things like weather, peak user times, and the types of games you play can greatly impact your experience regardless of satellite provider. For example, playing a solo real-time strategy game on a clear weekday will be a much smoother experience than playing an FPS on a stormy Saturday afternoon.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/tropico-6-uncovered-crafting-a-dictatorship-over-sun-kissed-shores/"><u>'Tropico 6' Uncovered: Crafting a Dictatorship Over Sun-Kissed Shores</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-best-phone-monitoring-apps-for-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 9 Best Phone Monitoring Apps for Samsung Galaxy A15 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-google-pixel-7a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Google Pixel 7a | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplifying-streaming-key-tactics-for-youtube-and-twitch-via-obs/"><u>In 2024, Simplifying Streaming Key Tactics for YouTube & Twitch via OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-applications-for-adding-audio-to-video-in-android/"><u>New Applications for Adding Audio to Video in Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/smart-escort-ix-examination-a-radar-detector-adapting-to-your-driving-habits/"><u>Smart Escort iX Examination: A Radar Detector Adapting to Your Driving Habits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-oppo-reno-8t-5g-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>Step-by-Step Tutorial How To Bypass Oppo Reno 8T 5G FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/the-premier-livestream-networks-you-need-to-watch/"><u>The Premier Livestream Networks You Need To Watch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-7-must-see-sites-for-the-latest-film-previews/"><u>Top 7 Must-See Sites for the Latest Film Previews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-car-bluetooth-adapter-of-2023-sumind-bt70b-transmitter-evaluation-and-features/"><u>Top-Rated Car Bluetooth Adapter of 2023 – Sumind BT70B Transmitter Evaluation & Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-tier-performance-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-netgear-nighthawk-c7000-router/"><u>Top-Tier Performance: A Comprehensive Guide to the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 Router</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-list-of-the-top-8-phone-game-titles/"><u>Ultimate List of the Top 8 Phone Game Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-list-the-finest-8-mobile-gaming-experiences/"><u>Ultimate List: The Finest 8 Mobile Gaming Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-outstanding.techidaily.com/un-regola-la-linea-passo-passo-su-come-burn-cd-con-windows-10-e-7-utilizzando-winxdvd-in-solo-quattro-fasi-facile/"><u>Un Regola La Linea Passo-Passo Su Come Burn CD Con Windows 10 E 7 Utilizzando WinXDVD in Solo Quattro Fasi Facile</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The original Xbox One controller has undergone quite a few changes and iterations over the console’s long life. You’ve got the original version that launched with the Xbox One, a slightly updated version of that, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-s-controller-review-4770950" >One S controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and then the Elite. Each of these controllers were pretty well-received in their day, but Microsoft carefully improved and updated them throughout the years to make them even better.</p><p> We reviewed the original $150 Elite controller when it debuted years ago and loved nearly every aspect of it, but it wasn’t flawless suffering from the lack of a few key features and some durability issues. This is where the newly updated Elite Series 2 controller comes in. Listening to feedback provided by gamers on the weaknesses of Series 1, Microsoft has put out what is likely to be the last iteration of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-consoles-4156250" >Xbox One controller, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it’s pretty much perfect—provided you’re willing to pay the hefty price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t8wI_yN2s_uIQ1leo87MmOnXxb4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-5-0c39ec4e89eb45b094471681efec0e7d.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044583/7443" target="_top" id="2044583">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044583" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044583/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed"><a href="#Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed" class="headerlink" title="Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed"></a><strong>Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed</strong></h2><p> The general format of the Elite Series 2 takes the basic XB1 controller and builds upon that excellent design by adding in tons of extras and features. However, unlike the first Elite controller, this version uses the newer One S model controller as its basis. This means there is no more two-piece design where the top and bottom shells of the controller are separate. The build is less flashy perhaps, no longer sporting a two-tone finish, but it makes it feel much more solid and creates a sleeker look.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout. The original Elite used brushed aluminum as an accent tone, but that’s been swapped for a darker gunmetal finish that I personally love. This accent tone is found along the top bumpers and triggers (that are now textured plastic), as well as the analog sticks and Xbox&#x2F;home button. You’ll also notice that the mini<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the top is now USB Type-C. Aside from my personal dream of this USB port becoming the universal design for all electronics, this implementation offers a superior port with better data transfer speeds and quicker charging times, so it’s nice to see here.</p><p> The grips this time have been heavily revamped (a welcome change as they were a point of weakness for durability on the Series 1), wrapping around the back, sides, and front for a seamless texture. Also changed from the previous Elite, these grips are no longer grey, but instead a nice black tone to match the rest of this black beauty.</p><p> For the face of the Series 2, the four iconic Xbox buttons are unchanged, but there are a few small changes elsewhere. The toggle switch from the Series 1 has now been swapped for a simple push-button that allows you to toggle between premade profiles with even more flexibility. It is easier to accidentally push, but we didn’t find it to be an issue.</p><p> One of the most striking changes to this area is the D-pad, which no longer sticks out from the design with its shiny aluminum surface. This time around, it’s sporting a flat black color that meshes much better with the overall look of the Series 2. It’s still got the radar-dish design that I personally find to be one of the best D-pad designs for any controller ever made.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout.</p><p> The rear of the Series 2 is slightly different from its predecessor, mainly the lack of a removable battery. Now this change is a bit polarizing for two main reasons. A rechargeable battery is super convenient since you can simply plug it in and juice it up, never having to worry about scrambling around for new batteries. On the other hand, this battery, like all rechargeable batteries, will ultimately wear down and eventually need replacing, which you can no longer do on your own. Much like smartphones that have ditched removable batteries, it seems like more and more devices are forgoing that option. We personally love the rechargeable pack included and supposedly it’ll last 10 years, but when it does get worn out, your only option is to send it in to have Microsoft replace it.</p><p> There is also a minimal charging strip where the battery sits, allowing you to use the included dock plugged into your USB-C cord to charge the controller when not in use. This dock is an excellent perk of the Series 2, negating the need for third-party docks that are often plagued with issues. I found it convenient to leave this dock plugged into the Xbox all the time so that I could place the controller there for a quick charge between gaming sessions or at the end of the night.</p><p> Battery aside, the rear of the Series 2 also features the optional paddles and extra buttons if you like to use those for added customization. The only difference with these is the finish, which now matches the dark tone of the D-pad. Lastly, the hair triggers return, but now have three different settings instead of two, providing even more potential customizing.</p><p> The final part of the design we’d like to discuss is the case. The first Elite also included a case, but this too has been refreshed for the Series 2. The first thing of note is that it isn’t quite the same case just rehashed. Close inspection shows that the material has also been changed a bit, making it smoother and less scratchy. The zipper also uses the new gunmetal finish. One of the more important changes to the case is that the top now includes a port for the charging dock, so you can even charge your controller right inside the case.</p><p> Inside the case, the material has also been swapped from grey to black to continue the darker theme of the Series 2. You’ll also notice the foam pad is no longer here, as that’s where the dock sits. This dock can be removed or used inside the case and attaches with a strong magnet. The last two parts of the case are unchanged from Series 1, with a mesh cradle for accessories on the top and a foam organizer to hold all the swappable thumbsticks and paddles when not in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRrezKVbAUPs2Rud3g4_iOHyxB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-2-4b3f9d8acd1440089989378253d902f4.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy"><a href="#Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy"></a><strong>Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy</strong></h2><p> The original Elite was perhaps the most comfortable controller I’ve ever used, so with the Series 2, I had high hopes in this department. Thanks to some clever but subtle changes by the Microsoft team, this controller is even better.</p><p> The main points of ergonomic superiority the Elite has over the cheaper XB1 controllers stem from the finish, grips and sheer customization that allows each user to tailor their controller to their preference. With so many options between different combinations of thumbsticks, D-pads, and paddles, everyone can find their optimal setup after some experimenting.</p><p> The grips are perhaps the most important part of this realm since that’s where your hands will be in contact with the controller most of the time. Luckily, they’re even better on the Series 2. While the original Elite only had rubberized grips along the back, the Series 2 has them wrapped around the full circumference of the device. This means your hands rest on them completely, providing a nice grippy surface that never gets slippery.</p><p> The last point of comfort I appreciated on the Series 2 is the textured triggers. While somewhat gimmicky, I found it to be better suited for quickly identifying between the triggers and bumpers, similar to how the home row on your keyboard has bumps on it.</p><p> The only real issue some users may see as a downside of this controller is that it’s quite a hefty device. The controller weighs 348 grams with all attachments, so it might take some getting used to compared to the 210 gram S controller. I personally love the bulk, as it feels premium, but it might not be for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cS5fpyPSlqvyETs-nGxTtAB3vXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-4-070b6c59b206457ba1068704bbe7bca9.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134236/18498" target="_top" id="2134236">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134236" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134236/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last"></a><strong>Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last</strong></h2><p> One of our biggest gripes with the original Elite controller was that it lacked Bluetooth functionality despite its premium price tag. Seeing how the much cheaper ONE S variant included this, it was even more frustrating. Thankfully, Microsoft listened to our collective rants and added Bluetooth to the Series 2, which drastically improves the number of devices it can be used with.</p><p> The overall setup process for the new Series 2 is quick and simple (more so than the first Elite). So let’s cover how to use it with both your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and PC. First things first, make sure the rechargeable battery is sufficiently charged (it comes charged out of the box) and you’re ready to pair it with the console.</p><p> To do so, turn on your console first and wait for it to fully boot. Now power on the controller and hold down the pairing button on the top until the Xbox symbol flashes. Then do the same thing on your console’s pairing button until both begin to rapidly flash (this indicates they are searching for each other). Once paired, the flashing will slow and then stop completely to show they have successfully paired.</p><p> As we stated earlier, the inclusion of Bluetooth means using the Series 2 with your PC is even easier than previous<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox One controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For those who plan to use their Elite Series 2 with a PC, this is perhaps the single best upgrade over the Series 1, because you no longer need the annoyingly large adapter to pair it with your PC (also saving you an additional $25).</p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC.</p><p> To do this, first ensure your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and your controller is also updated. Next, you can turn on the controller and head to the computer. At your desktop, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices, then turn Bluetooth on so it can discover the controller. After doing so, you should see “Xbox Wireless Controller” pop up, and you can now click “pair” from there and you’re ready to game.</p><p> For those who want to use their PC for local multiplayer games, it should also be noted that you can only connect one Bluetooth controller to your PC at a time. In addition to that limitation, you also can’t use any attachments like headsets, chat pads or the stereo adapter in this mode.</p><p> If you plan to buy this controller to use with other electronics that support Bluetooth devices, make sure you do some research before committing to it, as it doesn’t always work with everything. That said, we did manage to pair the controller with a couple other devices that weren’t officially supported.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v25KBj3XhkgWMjFaqVnLVUUJqSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-3-29dc70adabc64f888db60e817695153f.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability"><a href="#Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability" class="headerlink" title="Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability"></a><strong>Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability</strong></h2><p> To test the performance of the new Elite Series 2 controller, I put this device through several hours of gaming on both PC and Xbox One platforms running a number of games and layouts. The results were promising, so let’s take a closer look.</p><p> Enhanced performance in games is one of the big selling points of the Elite, which is marketed towards players who want to gain an advantage over those with regular controllers. While subtle, I did feel that the Elite improved some small aspects of my gameplay, though skill trumps this in every way.</p><p> For things like shooters, the hair triggers will give you a slight increase to reaction time, as there is less pull, but it takes some getting used to. The longer thumbsticks supposedly help with things like aim time, but getting used to them requires a bit of relearning to get the muscle memory rewired. Personally, I prefer the shorter sticks, but to each their own.</p><p> The paddles are great for adding additional functionality to your controller that non-Elite controllers can’t touch. For racing games like Forza, using these to shift gears means you can do so without having to move your fingers from other buttons. However, because these are unique to the Elite controllers, new users will have a steep learning curve to successfully implement them into their gameplay.</p><p> This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console.</p><p> The enhanced D-pad is perhaps my favorite piece of kit to instantly improve gaming performance. For things like platformers or fighting games, the dish design is exceptionally good at helping you to nail combos or tricky movements, and I always have it equipped.</p><p> No matter what games we used the Series 2 with, from Destiny 2 to Dragon Ball Fighter Z and more, we felt the controller added a subtle but noticeable boost to performance over a regular controller. That being said, it won’t drastically make you better, so don’t get your hopes up.</p><p> In terms of durability, this new Series 2 addresses several weaknesses of the Series 1. The rubber grips used to be a particularly weak point, coming unglued from the body over time. It seems like Microsoft have fixed this, but only time will tell.</p><p> The bumpers on every XB1 controller up until the One S were another point of failure due to the thin plastic piece that attached them to the controller. If you dropped your controller in just the right spot, even from a short height, they often broke and flopped around, requiring you to either send it in for repair or fix it yourself at home. The original Elite also suffered from this, and I experienced this with my first device. Now that the Series 2 is built off the S controller, this is supposedly no longer an issue.</p><p> While we didn’t experience any durability issues with our controller, the long-term durability will need to be assessed at a later date, though it seems to have gotten some upgrades to resolve issues of the past.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console"><a href="#Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console" class="headerlink" title="Price: Like buying a brand new console"></a><strong>Price: Like buying a brand new console</strong></h2><p> Right now, the Elite Series 2 controller retails at an MSRP of $249.99, about $100 more than its predecessor. This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console (or three brand new titles). That can be a tough sell for your average gamer.</p><p> Sure, all of the included extras, customization potential, and the ultra-premium feel is nice, but does that warrant the cost? Well, that’s for you to decide ultimately, but if you do plan on fully utilizing the customization potential, it’s probably worth it. Otherwise, the One S is probably sufficient.</p><p> The argument could be made that considering you get a Bluetooth controller capable of working on XB1 and PC, a charging dock and a nice little case to keep it all together, the cost isn’t awful. But if you want all of those things for less, you can grab an S controller, dock and case for far, far less.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6VfCJGOyjLkAkE_mjiHr7rz8Gyw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-6-0c1d7a2ae4e8443ea5b69f559e52bd12.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller"><a href="#Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller"></a><strong>Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller</strong></h2><p> Since the Elite controller really is in a league of its own, the biggest competitor to it is the first generation, which can still be purchased from a number of retailers. We’re going to quickly compare the two to see which might be best for you.</p><p> So we’ve covered a lot of the differences between the two series throughout this article, and while the second iteration is much improved over the first, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >original Elite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a perfectly capable controller with most of the same features. Now that the new one is out, the older model has also dropped a bit in price—making it more appealing. The price of the Series 1 can vary wildly from as little as $100 all the way up to the original tag of $150 depending on where you look, but saving up to $80 for a controller with mostly the same features is an excellent way to get into the Elite series for less.</p><p> Cost aside, there are a few key things you’ll lose if you go with the first model. Perhaps the most noteworthy advantage the Series 2 has is Bluetooth connectivity. This key feature means you no longer need the obtrusive USB wireless adapter to use it with a PC, and it’ll also work with more devices. The other major advantage is the durability improvements on the second iteration, which should make it last even longer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A truly awesome controller with a steep price point.</strong></p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC. However, the steep price point might be a hard pill to swallow for users who don’t like to splurge.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  400063527030</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Weight  2.89 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 3.6 x 7.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Type  Elite</li><li>Wired&#x2F;Wireless  Wireless</li><li>Removable Cable  Yes</li><li>Battery life  ~40 hours</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;outputs  USB Type-C, 3.5mm jack, Xbox data port</li><li>Warranty  90-day warranty</li><li>Compatibility  All Xbox One Consoles, Windows 10 PCs, Bluetooth devices</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-find-your-perfect-match-with-these-best-5-iphone-pods/"><u>[Updated] Find Your Perfect Match with These Best 5 iPhone Pods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-twitter-stream-success-beginners-roadmap/"><u>2024 Approved Twitter Stream Success Beginner's Roadmap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-mobvoi-ticwatch-e2-assessment-is-it-worth-the-savings/"><u>Affordable Mobvoi TicWatch E2 Assessment - Is It Worth the Savings?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/all-about-factory-reset-what-is-it-and-what-it-does-to-your-tecno-spark-10-4g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>All About Factory Reset, What Is It and What It Does to Your Tecno Spark 10 4G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-the-2021-apple-macbook-pro-with-m1-chip-the-ultimate-high-performance-laptop/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to the 2021 Apple MacBook Pro with M1 Chip – The Ultimate High-Performance Laptop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/dissecting-dialogues-unveiling-truth-about-ai-bot-capabilities/"><u>Dissecting Dialogues: Unveiling Truth About AI Bot Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/dive-into-the-world-of-windows-gaming-with-dxvk/"><u>Dive Into the World of Windows Gaming with DXVK</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-life360-from-tracking-you-on-vivo-t2-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Stop Life360 from Tracking You On Vivo T2 Pro 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-sharefake-gps-on-uber-for-oppo-a79-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to share/fake gps on Uber for Oppo A79 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/score-amazing-discounts-on-oneplus-dont-miss-out-this-prime-day/"><u>Score Amazing Discounts on OnePlus - Don't Miss Out This Prime Day!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ful-conversion-of-youtube-videos-to-interactive-gif-artistry/"><u>Skillful Conversion of YouTube Videos to Interactive GIF Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/the-virtual-stage-enhancement-zooms-filter-guidebook-for-2024/"><u>The Virtual Stage Enhancement Zoom's Filter Guidebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-home-security-on-a-budget-with-remobells-cost-effective-video-doorbell-s-review/"><u>Unlocking Home Security on a Budget with RemoBell's Cost-Effective Video Doorbell S Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-potential-a-thorough-review-of-the-netgear-c3700-gateway/"><u>Unlocking the Potential: A Thorough Review of the Netgear C3700 Gateway</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

of the very first things to consider when buying a home theater system is <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/under-100-budget-friendly-action-cams-top-choices-guide-for-2024/" >how many channels you want <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You’ll see numbers like 2.1, 5.1, or 7.2. These denote how many channels and, in many cases, how many individual speakers the system uses.</p><p> The first number is the number of standard audio channels, while the second is the number of subwoofers. A 2.1 system, for example, has two speakers for stereo sound and a subwoofer for low frequencies. A 5.1 system would have left and right, a center channel, two surround channels, and a subwoofer.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >Dolby Atmos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> adds a new dimension to the audio, quite literally. Atmos adds height, either through ceiling-mounted or, far more often, through upward-firing speakers. These add a dimension of height to the sound.</p><p> Generally, the more channels in a system, the more speakers it has, and the more complicated it will be to set up. This isn’t always the case, however. Soundbar systems usually have a central soundbar with satellite speakers and a subwoofer.</p><p> A system based on a soundbar will be easier to use but often won’t offer the same depth of sound that a system with individual speakers will. That said, soundbars have come a long way when it comes to sound quality, and the very best rival similar full-surround systems.</p><p> If you opt for a speaker-based system, one thing to keep in mind is whether it includes an amplifier or receiver. Many speaker systems leave it up to you to choose your own A&#x2F;V receiver, so keep this in mind when budgeting for your home theater system.</p><p> Finally, all those speakers mean wires all over your living room—unless you opt for a wireless system.

It manages to cram 5.1.4 channels of Dolby Atmos-ready sound into a deceptively simple package.</p><p> Setup is fairly simple with the base soundbar unit, two satellite speakers, and a subwoofer. While the satellite speakers require wires, you get a wireless subwoofer, which makes setting this system up an easy process.</p><p> While there are only a few speakers in this system, Vizio has equipped the Elevate soundbar with 18 individual speakers of its own. This helps give the system a depth and width beyond what you’d expect from a soundbar system.</p><p> Among these are four upward-firing speakers for Atmos and <a class="link"   href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ace-windows-10-tricks-to-save-time-and-energy/" >DTS:X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. A pair of adaptive height speakers even automatically rotate to add even more depth to the sound of your TV shows, movies, and music.</p><p> The Elevate soundbar also has other smart features, including a remote with a backlit display, making it easier to use when you’ve got the lights dimmed. Chromecast built-in lets the soundbar double as a speaker for music, podcasts, and other audio as well.</p><p> You can place the speakers anywhere you like, but for wall-mounted setups, Vizio includes mounting hardware for both the soundbar and satellite speakers. All and all, VIZIO’s Elevate Sound Bar is a perfect package for most people.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vizio-elevate-sound-bar.png"                      alt="VIZIO Elevate Sound Bar"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Home Theater System Overall</p><h5 id="VIZIO-Elevate-Sound-Bar-for-TV-1"><a href="#VIZIO-Elevate-Sound-Bar-for-TV-1" class="headerlink" title="VIZIO Elevate Sound Bar for TV"></a>VIZIO Elevate Sound Bar for TV</h5><p>$700 $799 Save $99 </p><p>If you’re looking for a set it and forget it home theater system but still want Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, this is it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-Surround-Subwoofer-Bluetooth-P514a-H6/dp/B08BNQDL1J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$700 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio__514channel_el/6420000.p?skuId=6420000" >See at bestbuy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Budget-Home-Theater-System-Logitech-Z906-5-1-Surround-Sound"><a href="#Best-Budget-Home-Theater-System-Logitech-Z906-5-1-Surround-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Home Theater System: Logitech Z906 5.1 Surround Sound"></a>Best Budget Home Theater System: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Logitech Z906 5.1 Surround Sound <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Logitech-Z906.jpg"                      alt="Logitech Z906 on entertainment center"                > Logitech</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Actual speaker-per-channel 5.1 setup</td><td>✗ No HDMI connectivity</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Multiple connectivity options</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ 3D Stereo option makes stereo into surround sound</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> If you don’t want a soundbar, but still want the simplicity of a system based on a soundbar, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Logitech Z906 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic option. You get everything you need all in one package but still have a complete 5.1-channel setup.</p><p> This THX-certified home theater system doesn’t feature Dolby Atmos or DTS:X, as there are no upward-firing speakers. That said, it does feature <a class="link"   href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/in-2024-adjusting-windows-11-settings-for-adaptive-hdr/" >DTS and Dolby Digital <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, ensuring that everything you hear out of this system is crystal clear.</p><p> Unlike many “home theater in a box” solutions, the Logitech Z906 features one speaker per channel. That means you’re getting stereo, left and right, and left and right surround channels as well as a subwoofer.</p><p> The subwoofer here is substantial, given the overall price. You get an eight-inch driver powered by a 165-watt amplifier in the subwoofer, enough to add significant bass to explosions, thundering engines, or anything else that makes your movies more exciting.</p><p> One interesting inclusion in the Z906 is something Logitech calls “3D Stereo.” This takes older movies and TV shows or any other stereo audio content and expands it to encompass the room via the surround channels. It’s a neat audio upgrade that not every home theater setup can do!</p><p> The Logitech Z906 doesn’t feature HDMI, but it does feature inputs for up to six devices split between analog and digital inputs. You get RCA analog, digital coaxial, and digital optical ports.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/logitech-z906-5-1-surround-sound-speaker-system.png"                      alt="Logitech Z906 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886044/19272" target="_top" id="1886044">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886044" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886044/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Budget Home Theater System</p><h5 id="Logitech-Z906-5-1-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System-1"><a href="#Logitech-Z906-5-1-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System-1" class="headerlink" title="Logitech Z906 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System"></a>Logitech Z906 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System</h5><p>The Logitech Z906 packs a complete 5.1-channel home theater system into a single box, with only a few minor compromises for the price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Surround-Sound-Speaker-System/dp/B004M18O60?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$399 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Wireless-Home-Theater-System-VIZIO-M-Series-5-1-Premium-Sound-Bar"><a href="#Best-Wireless-Home-Theater-System-VIZIO-M-Series-5-1-Premium-Sound-Bar" class="headerlink" title="Best Wireless Home Theater System: VIZIO M-Series 5.1 Premium Sound Bar"></a>Best Wireless Home Theater System: <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-Theater-Sound-Dolby-Atmos/dp/B094TLY3FQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >VIZIO M-Series 5.1 Premium Sound Bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-Theater-Sound-Dolby-Atmos/dp/B094TLY3FQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-Theater-Sound-Dolby-Atmos/dp/B094TLY3FQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vizio-m-series.jpg"                      alt="VIZIO M-Series on pink and yellow background"                > VIZIO</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none;

Having to run wires for all the other speakers is often close to impossible. Fortunately, with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-Theater-Sound-Dolby-Atmos/dp/B094TLY3FQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >VIZIO M-Series 5.1 Premium Sound Bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, those worries are mostly taken care of for you.</p><p> This package consists of the main soundbar, a subwoofer, and two satellite speakers. Though that’s only four speakers, this system can handle not only standard 5.1-channel surround sound but also Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.</p><p> While the M-Series soundbar is mostly wireless, it isn’t totally wireless. First, you need to plug the soundbar and subwoofer into the wall. Second, the satellite speakers aren’t wireless. Instead, they connect to the subwoofer, which is still much handier than running wires from the soundbar itself.</p><p> There are two ways to connect the soundbar to your TV, with the intended connection being the HDMI port. This carries audio from your TV to the soundbar via HDMI audio return channel (ARC). Even better, this model features eARC, so you can pass Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision through to the TV, as well as control the soundbar with your TV remote.</p><p> If you don’t have a TV equipped with eARC or ARC, you can connect using the optical digital audio input. The soundbar also has a 3.5mm auxiliary port and a second 3.5mm port for connecting voice assistants like the Amazon Echo.</p><p> Finally, you can also connect using Bluetooth, which makes listening to music from your phone easy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/vizio-m-series-5-1-premium-sound-bar.png"                      alt="VIZIO M-Series 5.1 Premium Sound Bar"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Wireless Home Theater System</p><h5 id="VIZIO-M-Series-5-1-Premium-Sound-Bar-1"><a href="#VIZIO-M-Series-5-1-Premium-Sound-Bar-1" class="headerlink" title="VIZIO M-Series 5.1 Premium Sound Bar"></a>VIZIO M-Series 5.1 Premium Sound Bar</h5><p>$300 $330 Save $30 </p><p>The VIZIO M-Series 5.1 Premium Sound Bar may not be completely wireless, but in practice it might as well be.

You get the main soundbar, dual 8-inch subwoofers, and a pair of rear speakers. Unlike many satellite speakers, the rear speakers are two-way, pairing a tweeter and a woofer for fuller surround sound.</p><p> The main soundbar faces two speakers outward instead of forward.

There is no wireless connectivity—and really no connectivity to speak of at all, other than speaker connectors.</p><p> The main highlight of this system is the pair of Klipsch Reference R-26FA floor-standing speakers, which feature built-in <a class="link"   href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-your-bricked-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-in-minutes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/" >Dolby Atmos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> elevation channel speakers.

Combined with the overall size of the speakers and the 12-inch subwoofer, you’re guaranteed room-filling sound.</p><p> In addition to the sound, the black and copper color scheme that marks Klipsch’s Reference line looks great anywhere. The speakers are guaranteed to last as well, as they’re covered by Klipsch’s five-year warranty.</p><p> Of course, as this is a collection of passive speakers (aside from the active subwoofer), you’ll need a receiver capable of 7.1 or 7.2-channel sound, like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-NR5100-Channel-Network-Receiver/dp/B099X8SGJ5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207677&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/772995/best-home-theater-system/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Onkyo TX-NR5100 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/klipsch-reference-r-26fa-7-1-home-theater-system.png"                      alt="Klipsch Reference R-26FA 7.1 Home Theater System"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/htg-best-of-2024-1.png"                                     > </p><p>Best 7.1 Home Theater System</p><h5 id="Klipsch-Reference-R-26FA-1"><a href="#Klipsch-Reference-R-26FA-1" class="headerlink" title="Klipsch Reference R-26FA"></a>Klipsch Reference R-26FA</h5><p>Klipsch’s 7.1-channel package takes the difficulty out of picking fantastic-sounding home theater speakers.
