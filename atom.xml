Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR sound card was a great card in 2013. In 2019, however, the ZxR has started to lag behind the competition. It provides pretty clear audio, but it requires two PCIe slots and costs $250 MSRP. Compare this to products from other audio card manufacturers, such as ASUS and EVGA, which been able to provide better audio performance for as little as $160. That said, the Sound Blaster ZxR isn’t without merits: it has a lot of inputs and outputs, extensive EQ software, and still produces quality sound. It also has features gamers need, such as treble boost and voice isolation, and it accommodates 6.3mm auxiliary input and output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U_vmwZDe5HbbungQ5L2hzf2LVto=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-4-b0d1cca56ec04a61b83e20d1cecf2aea.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-convenient"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-convenient" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and convenient"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and convenient</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR features a black and red chassis on its main and daughter boards, brightly accented in gold around the transistors and back plate. Together, the cards have enough outputs to natively support a 5.1 surround sound speaker system. They have 2 RCA outputs, 2 3.5mm outputs, two RCA inputs, one optical TOSLINK input, one optical TOSLINK output, one 6.3mm microphone input, and one 6.3 headphone output jack. The ZxR also comes with an Audio Control Module (ACM), which is Creative Labs’ take on an amplifier and on extending the 6.3mm connections. It has both 3.5mm and 6.3mm inputs and outputs so you can choose where you’d like to plug in your headphones and microphone. On the ACM’s face lies a big, plastic volume knob that controls the headphones’ loudness.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Some-odd-decisions"><a href="#Hardware-Some-odd-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Hardware: Some odd decisions"></a><strong>Hardware: Some odd decisions</strong></h2><p> For users who may own higher impedance headphones, the amplifier can comfortably drive headphones with up to a 600 ohm impedance. Unfortunately, the volume control on the ACM works passively by altering the output impedance, which can distort audio on headphones with high inductance like the Sennheiser HD800 (see “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-output-impedance-4690092" >How Low Should Output Impedance Be? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ”). A better and only slightly more costly solution for Creative Labs would have been to have the knob control the ZxR’s in-built volume control rather than try to do it passively. The HD800 sounded fine when plugged directly into the sound card and using the system volume control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1t84P8oe4qch2aJ6lknx0lwunWw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-2-de43d07bd3db40a282f55347c8956c9a.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100542/7443" target="_top" id="2100542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup"><a href="#Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup"></a><strong>Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup</strong></h2><p> To install the hardware, we popped open our mid-size PC tower and inserted the sound card and daughter board into two available PCIe slots. Creative Labs had the foresight to build the main card with a PCIe 1x slots, giving the user flexibility in where they connect their cards to the motherboard. Once the cards were secured, we plugged the headphones and microphone into the corresponding jacks.</p><p> It’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP.</p><p> Unfortunately, configuring Creative Labs’ drivers and software suite was a much less intuitive process. The ZxR’s outputs are controlled via the Sound Blaster Z-series Software, where users can select whether they’re listening with their headphones or their speakers, apply EQ effects, and more. By default, the software is set to output to speakers with several different EQ effects turned on. We had to manually switch it to headphone output and turn off EQ; the software does not automatically detect which jacks are in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6uorHzKoJdW1FBv0B5ZfeoE8XzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-3-17de2156e4294b5c85f151bd0cd97aa4.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134244/18498" target="_top" id="2134244">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134244" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134244/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Excellent-sound"><a href="#Audio-Excellent-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Excellent sound"></a><strong>Audio: Excellent sound</strong></h2><p> Once the EQ effects are turned off, the Sound Blaster ZxR provides beautiful sound. While it wasn’t quite as clean or crisp as an enthusiast audiophile amplifier, such as the OPPO HA-1, it was solid for a system that costs a quarter of the HA-1’s price. On the HD-800s, the bass came across slightly muddy, but the ZxR provides solid quality for consumer-grade headphones like the Sennheiser GSP300 or the Sony MDR-7506. As our our<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/headphones-buying-guide-4172763" >headphone buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggests, most headphones under $250 will not be sensitive enough to meaningfully distinguish between the ZxR and the HA-1.</p><p> Should you happen to own dynamic headphones, you should find their impedance curve. Dynamic headphones with a high impedance may be distorted by the ACM, thanks to the ACM’s high resistance. How your headphones will be affected depends on their impedance curve: for the HD800s, for example, there is a peak at 100Hz (this range captures electric bass and the lower octaves of guitars), so the upper bass range is boosted relative to the other frequencies in the audio. Increasing the volume on the ACM reduces its output resistance and in turn reduces the distortion, but it may be easier to plug equipment directly into the sound card and use the system volume instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1CZw4BSxxTqlBF1kxT0_rl73XCU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-5-e1022e9adc854517af98407c4be32691.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options with mixed utility"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options with mixed utility</strong></h2><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package. Here, you can EQ any frequency between 20 and 20,000 Hz or activate “Crystallization,” “Scout Mode,” and “Theater Mode.” Crystallization adds punch to the audio’s treble, making voices stand out against the background. Theater Mode is similar to Crystallization, but it tries to_only_ boost voices instead of the entire treble range. We found it great for watching videos. Meanwhile, Scout Mode is squarely aimed at gamers. It theoretically makes enemy noises like footsteps louder.</p><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package.</p><p> When testing Scout Mode in_Overwatch_ , we did not find the adjustment helpful; Scout Mode made our enemies’ and our allies’ movements louder, making it harder to tell where the enemy was coming from. Without adjustments,<em>Overwatch’s</em> audio already makes the enemies’ movements louder than your allies’, making Scout Mode not only ineffective but an active detriment to gameplay. Other games that strongly rely on situational awareness have also likely invested the time into making enemies’ movements noticeable. Overall the software modifications Sound Blaster provides are situationally useful but not the comprehensive range of options we’d like to see at this price point.</p><h2 id="Price-Unjustified-expense"><a href="#Price-Unjustified-expense" class="headerlink" title="Price: Unjustified expense"></a><strong>Price: Unjustified expense</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR retails for about $250, on par with other high-end consumer audio cards. Its 6.3mm audio and microphone jacks, coupled with support for headphone impedance of up to 600 ohms, gives the listener flexibility in the rest of their audio setup: no need for 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapters or extension cords. One major hardware disappointment is its lack of 7.1 surround compatibility, which is something many sound card enthusiasts prize in a high-end sound card. There are also a number of other products with better sound quality for less than the ZxR’s $250 MSRP.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short of less expensive options"></a><strong>Competition:</strong> <strong>Falls short of less expensive options</strong></h2><p> As we’ve already emphasized, it’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP. You can find a number of sound cards for significantly less that provide competitive performance, though they generally don’t offer the same robust software package as the ZxR.</p><p> For a fraction of the price ($99 MSRP), you could get your hands on the Schitt Audio Fulla, an external DAC&#x2F;AMP set that covers 16 to 300 ohm headphones with plenty of power and has a clean, no-nonsense design. While it doesn’t offer the level of software support as the ZxR (those who want to dive deep into live microphone sound manipulation may not find what they need), for the consumer looking to delve into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hi-res-audio-4134630" >Hi-Fi audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this is an excellent deal.</p><p> At the $215 mark, still well below the price of the ZxR, the EVGA Nu audio card performs as well as external DAC&#x2F;AMPs in the $1,000 range. It also has minimalist software which Sound Blaster devotees may find a little feature-light, but even given the dearth of software options the EVGA Nu is the clear winner.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/evga-nu-audio-card-review-4769828" >EVGA Nu Audio Card Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> For about $160, the Asus Strix Raid PRO delivers better audio than the Sound Blaster ZxR and a control module that’s more useful than the ACM. The Strix’s “control box” has a button to turn EQ presets on and off, to change output between headphones and speakers, and all the features of the ACM (save 6.3mm jacks). The EQ button, which Asus calls the Raid button, is especially useful for gamers to switch between modes in-game.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-strix-raid-pro-review-4769832" >ASUS Strix Raid PRO Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good card that’s showing its age.</strong></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR is a quality, expensive sound card, with comprehensive software features and the hardware to power great consumer headsets and microphones. The ZxR sounds good, and gamers will not be disappointed by the ZxR’s power, but audio purists and 7.1 surround fans can find cleaner performance with fewer bells and whistles for the $250 asking price of the ZxR. It’s a card that hasn’t aged well since it’s 2013 release, and one that’s been largely overshadowed by some of its competitors in the interim.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-z-review-4769764" >Sound Blaster Z <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-audigy-rx-review-4769814" >Sound Blaster Audigy RX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068417/7443" target="_top" id="2068417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068417/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Sound Blaster ZxR</li><li>Product Brand  Creative</li><li>UPC  Model Number SB1510</li><li>Price  $250.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2013</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.6 x 4.1 x 7.9 in.</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Main Card)  6.3mm Headphone Out, 2x 3.5mm Out, 2x RCA Out, 6.3mm Microphone In</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Daughterboard)  2x 3.5mm RCA In, Optical TOSLINK In, Optical TOSLINK Out</li><li>Audio Interface  PCI Express</li><li>Frequency Response  100Hz to 20kHz (microphone); 10Hz to 45kHz (headphones)</li><li>Output Signal-to-Noise Ratio  124 dB</li><li>Headphone Amplifier  16-600 ohms</li><li>Chipset  Sound Core 3D</li><li>Digital-to-Analog Converters  Burr-Brown PCM1794 and PCM1798</li><li>Headphone Op-Amps (Swappable)  New Japan Radio NJM2114D</li><li>Headphone Driver  Texas Instruments TPA6120A2</li><li>Line Out Op-Amps (Swappable)  Texas Instruments LME49710</li><li>Capacitors  Nichicon</li><li>Software  Sound Blaster Z-Series Software</li><li>What’s Included  Sound Blaster ZxR sound card, Sound Blaster DBpro card, Sound Blaster Audio Control Module, 1Optical Cable, 1x Stereo(3.5mm)-to-RCA cable, 1x DBpro cable, Quick Start Leaflet, Installation CD containing: Drivers for Windows 7 and Windows 8, Creative Software Suite, User’s Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-microphone-setup-in-audacity-for-mac/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Microphone Setup in Audacity for Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-techs-elite-selection-the-top-10-video-recorders-online/"><u>2024 Approved Tech's Elite Selection The Top 10 Video Recorders Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-fujitsn-scansnap-ix1600-top-tier-document-scanner/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Fujitsn ScanSnap iX1600 - Top-Tier Document Scanner</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/decoding-the-apple-m4-chip-when-it-hits-shelves-how-it-works-and-its-capabilities/"><u>Decoding the Apple M4 Chip: When It Hits Shelves, How It Works, and Its Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/dive-into-visual-and-auditory-brilliance-with-the-newly-tested-huawei-mediapad-m5/"><u>Dive Into Visual and Auditory Brilliance with the Newly Tested Huawei MediaPad M5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location-on-oneplus-ace-2v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location On OnePlus Ace 2V?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111967/7443" target="_top" id="2111967">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111967" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111967/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144272/7443" target="_top" id="2144272">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144272" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144272/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868575/19272" target="_top" id="1868575">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868575" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868575/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them"><a href="#Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them"></a><strong>Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them</strong></h2><p> During our testing, the Apeman C450 performed exactly as we expected. It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode. If you can get past some of its foibles, it’s definitely worth the price tag.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddpai-mini3-review-4770579" >DDpai mini3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/rexing-v1-dashcam-review-4770571" >Rexing V1 DashCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-roav-dashcam-c1-review-4773139" >Anker Roav DashCam C1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C450 Dash Cam</li><li>Product Brand  Apeman</li><li>MPN  X0023JN4OL</li><li>Price  $39.99</li><li>Weight  12 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.3 x 4.2 x 3.8 in.</li><li>Camera  170-degree FOV, WDR</li><li>Recording Quality  1080p</li><li>Crash Detection  Yes</li><li>Parking Mode  Yes</li><li>Connectivity options  USB</li><li>Storage  Up to 32GB SDHC card (Class 10)</li><li>Warranty  12 months</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mirth-merger-image-composer/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mirth Merger Image Composer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-navigate-through-youtube-content-with-flexibility/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Navigate Through YouTube Content with Flexibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-affordable-action-cams-for-beginners-for-2024/"><u>[New] Affordable Action Cams for Beginners for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-best-10-collage-apps-for-android-top-picks/"><u>[New] Best 10 Collage Apps for Android ​ (Top Picks)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-integrating-twitter-videos-into-facebook-social-graph/"><u>[New] Integrating Twitter Videos Into Facebook Social Graph</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-incorporating-youtube-harmonies-within-video-sequences/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Incorporating YouTube Harmonies Within Video Sequences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/easy-to-follow-procedures-for-keeping-your-ati-radeon-graphics-card-updated-in-windows-operating-system/"><u>Easy-to-Follow Procedures for Keeping Your ATI Radeon Graphics Card Updated in Windows Operating System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/evaluating-the-owc-mercury-pro-a-high-performance-storage-solution-reviewed/"><u>Evaluating the OWC Mercury Pro: A High-Performance Storage Solution Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/graphics-card-swap-for-better-laptop-display/"><u>Graphics Card Swap for Better Laptop Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/serene-tech-your-ultimate-beachpool-companion/"><u>Serene Tech: Your Ultimate Beach/Pool Companion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-football-video-game-a-comprehensive-fifa-19-review/"><u>Top Rated Football Video Game: A Comprehensive FIFA 19 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/dvd-copy-pro/"><u>WinX DVD Copy Pro</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> There’s a lot to love about the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-2-review-5092839" >Oculus Quest 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The standalone, wireless headset is easily the best VR experience for the majority of buyers, packing in solid power, a great screen, and quality games at the fantastic price of $299. But there are a couple of downgrades from the original, pricier Oculus Quest model, and the flimsy strap is chief among them.</p><p> While certainly usable, the Quest 2’s included fabric strap isn’t particularly effective at keeping the headset firmly and comfortably positioned on your face. Luckily, Quest 2 owners have another option if they’re willing to spend extra cash: the official Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap.</p><p> Available on its own for $49 or with a battery pack and carrying case for $129, the Elite Strap is a major improvement and worthwhile pickup for anyone who doesn’t love the original fit. I tested the latter configuration with the integrated battery pack and included case.</p><h2 id="Design-A-more-supportive-strap"><a href="#Design-A-more-supportive-strap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A more supportive strap"></a>Design: A more supportive strap</h2><p> While the standard Oculus Quest 2 strap is simply made up of fabric bands—one around the back of your head and the other over the top—the Elite Strap is mostly plastic and significantly more supportive. That’s because it helps offset the weight of the visor itself by using the back of your head to securely keep the entire headset in place, thus minimizing its ability to sag or feel heavy on your face.</p><p> The Elite Strap does this by having a soft plastic, oval-like brace at the back, which gently presses against the back of your head. It’s supported in part by a single fabric strap on the top, but more crucially by a locking mechanism on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/g-QXyXCZitYdlr7F5TWDuzllhuY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_02-83833091dfde4b3b9e2253177901bb66.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136536/16384" target="_top" id="2136536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136536/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Unlike the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-vr-4157636" >PlayStation VR’s strap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example, the Quest 2 Elite Strap’s fit wheel doesn’t lock into place and make you press a button to release it from your head when you want out. Instead, you can gradually adjust it until the headset feels snug but comfortable, and freely tighten or loosen it as needed. It stays put.</p><p> It’s a big upgrade over the normal Quest 2 strap. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-review-4692669" >original Quest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> had a simple plastic strap, but it was a step up from what Oculus shipped with the sequel. The Elite Strap represents an improvement upon both standard designs, and it’s one of the best VR headset straps around. It’s secure, easy to use, and comfortable, checking every box on the list.</p><p> The Elite Strap is a major improvement and worthwhile pickup for anyone who doesn’t love the original strap’s fit.</p><p> This particular Elite Strap model has a battery pack built into the back part of the strap, within the plastic housing. It doesn’t feel heavy or noticeable, although there must be a weight difference between this version and the standalone, battery-less Elite Strap option.</p><p> Meanwhile, the included carrying case in this bundle is large enough to fit the entire headset with the Elite Strap, as well as the two Oculus Touch controllers and the charger. The large pill-shaped design is non-traditional for a gadget case, looking like light grey sweatpants and with a wool-like felt texture. The case can be a little awkward to unzip, but it’s functional and roomy enough to hold everything, even if it doesn’t look nearly as cool as what it holds.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Snap-it-on"><a href="#Setup-Process-Snap-it-on" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Snap it on"></a>Setup Process: Snap it on</h2><p> Oculus built in a clever strap support system with the Quest 2 that lets you securely and seamlessly attach different kinds of straps. When you remove the standard strap, you’ll be left with these plastic “wings” on either side of the visor, and those snap right into the Elite Strap’s plastic bands to firmly attach it to the visor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kePEj93uGIlmO7iyZMsHMaUpHEE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_03-4d5ab74d783144e0aee262248d5cdb89.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2127886">                    <video width="576" height="1024" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2127886">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2127886%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2127886/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> Once it’s secured, simply plug the USB-C cable on the side of the Elite Strap into the Quest 2 visor, as this adds power from the battery pack into your total supply. Now you’ll charge the entire headset via the USB-C port beneath the dial on the Elite Strap, which provides power to both the visor and strap batteries.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Effective-and-adjustable"><a href="#Comfort-Effective-and-adjustable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Effective and adjustable"></a>Comfort: Effective and adjustable</h2><p> Comfort is one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Elite Strap, and a major reason anyone would consider paying $49 or more for a different strap. Some people might find the Oculus Quest 2’s strap to be perfectly fine, but in my own testing, it was just tolerable: The headset felt heavy and was never as securely fastened in place as I wanted it to be. It was a big step down from the original Quest’s solid, rubberized plastic strap.</p><p> [The strap] helps take away some of the friction that bad straps can create, letting you sink further into the immersive illusion.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap fixes that issue for me, and I can’t imagine anyone will find it to be less comfortable than the standard strap. It’s a clever design that pulls inspiration from previous VR headsets to ably support the weight of the visor, while still allowing for subtle adjustments without needing to take the headset off your dome. It feels great in use, and more importantly, it helps take away some of the friction that bad straps can create, letting you sink further into the immersive illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v5qFVd_vGEfVkRoTgyxHCnpNO7Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_04-6b671f2308db4225b4f355d0abd12f2d.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Battery-Double-the-uptime"><a href="#Battery-Double-the-uptime" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Double the uptime"></a>Battery: Double the uptime</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2’s built-in battery lasts only about two hours, and the Elite Strap’s secondary 4,676mAh pack effectively doubles that tally. It adds roughly two more hours of use, meaning you’ll have the freedom to play for much longer sessions and&#x2F;or charge the headset less often.</p><p> I haven’t personally had any issue with the Quest 2’s modest battery, as I rarely play VR for more than an hour at a time. However, as more immersive games are released, as people use VR for social interactions, and as you might spend more time watching idle content (like movies) in a virtual reality setting, that extra buffer could come in handy. The Quest 2 sips power from the Elite Strap’s battery first, and as previously mentioned, one USB-C plug charges the whole thing.</p><p> The battery pack adds roughly two more hours of use, meaning you’ll have the freedom to play for much longer sessions and&#x2F;or charge the headset less often.</p><p> Granted, there are DIY options out there for boosting the Quest 2’s battery life, including plugging in a portable power bank and either sticking it into your pocket or otherwise affixing it to your body or headset. Depending on the size of the power bank, you could get significantly more uptime from that kind of solution and at a lower cost—but that’s more hassle and it’s a less elegant solution than the official option here.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-cheap-but-it’s-worth-it"><a href="#Price-Not-cheap-but-it’s-worth-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not cheap, but it’s worth it"></a>Price: Not cheap, but it’s worth it</h2><p> After spending $299 on a VR headset, some might bristle at spending another $49 for a different strap—or $129 for that strap, double the battery life, and a case. However, if the Quest 2’s standard strap isn’t meeting your needs, then the Elite Strap is well worth the extra cash.</p><p> It eliminates one of the common pain points of the Quest 2 experience, letting you focus more on the VR experience rather than how you’re accessing it. The Quest 2 is already incredibly well-priced for a standalone VR console, and still feels like a great value even if you factor in another $49 for the Elite Strap.</p><p> Do you need the whole bundle with the battery pack and case, though? If you typically use the Quest 2 in short sessions and don’t mind plugging it in on a regular basis, then probably not. The battery_can_ be a major benefit, particularly if you find yourself sticking around in VR for longer time spans, but that’s not always the case for users. The Elite Strap, in my view, provides the greatest enhancement within this bundle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/edSGh2YZZ5OIkwkHbEJnwtUjfGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus_Quest_2_Elite_Strap_05-e018715e02944614b51af8a2cb98f055.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery and Carrying Case"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137208/26400" target="_top" id="2137208">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137208" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137208/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> The case is nice to have, and given that the original official Oculus Quest case sold for $40 on its own, this bundle doesn’t feel overpriced by comparison. Buying the Oculus Quest 2 headset plus this bundle comes out to nearly the same price as buying the original Quest headset ($399) plus its carrying case back when, but now you get double the battery life along with the myriad enhancements of the core Quest 2 hardware.</p><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-Elite-Strap-vs-Orzero-Adjustable-Headband-for-Quest-2"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-Elite-Strap-vs-Orzero-Adjustable-Headband-for-Quest-2" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap vs. Orzero Adjustable Headband for Quest 2"></a>Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap vs. Orzero Adjustable Headband for Quest 2</h2><p> There’s a number of third-party straps for the Quest 2 out there, no doubt encouraged by the severe supply shortage of the Elite Strap following its release. Orzero’s Adjustable Headband for Oculus Quest 2 (view at<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MFH6V6C/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5193587%7Cn10531399cf62445bbb649a7878d1155511%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a well-reviewed alternative that’s a bit different in look, thanks to a much larger plastic shell on the back of your head, but it appears to work similarly to the official Elite Strap. It’s $10 cheaper than the official option, so it could be a good substitute or cheaper alternative. There is no version with a built-in battery pack, however.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A truly Elite addition to the Quest 2.</strong></p><p> If your Oculus Quest 2 doesn’t quite fit right, pick up the Elite Strap. It’s a much better-designed strap that securely and comfortably keeps the VR headset in place during use, and is well worth the extra cash. True, you might grimace at the thought of spending more money on something that should’ve come with the standard headset, but the improved experience should ultimately outweigh that frustration. The bundle with the battery pack and carrying case adds further value and is worthwhile if you’re keen on longer play sessions or not needing to charge the headset as often, but the Elite Strap itself is the most essential add-on in this set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-quest-2-review-5092839" >Oculus Quest 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-rift-review-4690370" >Oculus Rift Headset and Controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oculus-go-vr-headset-review-4690298" >Oculus Go Standalone VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Quest 2 Elite Strap with Battery and Carrying Case</li><li>Product Brand  Oculus</li><li>UPC  815820021056</li><li>Price  $129.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2020</li><li>Weight  11.36 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  13 x 6.75 x 4.5 in.</li><li>Color  White&#x2F;Black</li><li>Ports  USB-C</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-adding-divisions-to-vimeos-media-shows/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Adding Divisions to Vimeo's Media Shows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-cross-platform-sync-made-simple-post-tiktok-vids-on-fb-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cross-Platform Sync Made Simple Post TikTok Vids on FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-riding-through-the-year-motorcycles-no-1-helmet-cameras-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Riding Through the Year -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re sick and tired of running out of USB ports, and you never want to fumble with the back of your computer again, Anker has you covered. The Anker<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-3-0-2626038" >USB 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub seeks to end your connectivity woes at once, providing nine USB 3.0 data ports and one charging optimized data port, capable of delivering more than twice as much juice as the rest.</p><p> If you need a no-frills solution to your USB port problem, the Anker is a pretty good choice. This straightforward solution does exactly what it sets out to with little fuss. Still, there is competition lurking out there, and some of it is coming from other Anker products. Let’s explore the pros and cons and determine if this is the right choice for your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kGkNOMrJekQ_xSVZJ4N4nLG1il0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_02-dbb624f3c041432baecfa2701dbc933a.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049391/7443" target="_top" id="2049391">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049391" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049391/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Lots-of-ports-in-a-standard-configuration"><a href="#Design-Lots-of-ports-in-a-standard-configuration" class="headerlink" title="Design: Lots of ports in a standard configuration"></a><strong>Design: Lots of ports in a standard configuration</strong></h2><p> At 1.7 x 5.7 x 0.9 inches HWD), the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub is just about as lean as one might reasonably expect for a device with this many ports. The design is relatively simple, featuring a long rectangular shape, rounded edges, and a thick plastic construction. The device feels very light, but it’s not flimsy.</p><p> The top of the device includes the ten USB 3.0 ports, the last of which is marked with a charging icon.</p><p> The top of the device includes the ten USB 3.0 ports, the last of which is marked with a charging icon. Each port has a number next to it that illuminates when a device is connected. Above the first port is a power LED to indicate a power connection. Around to the side from this LED is the power port and USB 3.0 type B port.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tQ3zuDbd3YhyVxZS3iM0i5RcsOc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_03-1167acd92ea14e1db605adf2154e0d60.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-painless"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-painless" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Quick and painless"></a><strong>Setup Process: Quick and painless</strong></h2><p> To set up the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub, remove the main hub from its packaging and connect the supplied USB (A-to-B) cable to both the hub and your computer. Next, connect the power source to an outlet. After that, the hub works out of the box. The manual provides a cursory overview of the operation of the device, but you likely won’t need it.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Data-and-fast-charging"><a href="#Connectivity-Data-and-fast-charging" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Data and fast charging"></a><strong>Connectivity: Data and fast charging</strong></h2><p> The Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub comes with a USB (A-to-B) cable to connect to your computer. An AC power adapter is included as well, and comes with a sizable power brick. The hub gives users ten USB 3.0 ports, offering a maximum transfer speed of 5Gbps. The charging port delivers more power than the other 9 making it ideal for charging more power hungry devices like phones and tablets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LqAWiFxZU1YqrVq2KbjQzkz6xMI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_04-0c115139eb2842759c6a8ceb22719901.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Performance-A-few-shortcomings"><a href="#Performance-A-few-shortcomings" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A few shortcomings"></a><strong>Performance: A few shortcomings</strong></h2><p> The Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub performed as promised in our tests, providing the expected 5Gbps speeds. The first nine ports supply the standard 0.9A of power, whereas the final charging port can supply up to 2.0A. If you neglect to connect the hub to a power source, the entire device will have to share the 0.9A of power supplied by your computer’s USB 3.0 port.</p><p> This straightforward solution does exactly what it sets out to with little fuss.</p><p> One area we take issue with Anker is in their product description online, which cautions against using the hub with high-power consumption devices, such as external hard drives. This might just be to protect themselves from liability, but it’s a frustrating cop-out, as a significant reason for buying a powered USB hub in the first place is to avoid potential issues with external hard drives that stem from inadequate power supply.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fKjtHR68Qc_w-DpUN_vILXXO77o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Anker_UsbHubs_4LW4142295_05-418b32eddbca47968b9a9043db285b2f.jpg"                      alt="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="701707">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-701707">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fappsumo.8odi.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F701707%2F7443'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/701707/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997675/19272" target="_top" id="1997675">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997675" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997675/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-little-steep-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-A-little-steep-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: A little steep for the features"></a><strong>Price: A little steep for the features</strong></h2><p> At a list price of $52.99, the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub is a little expensive for what it offers. We would have expected a price of around $10-13 less given the feature set. Anker itself offers cheaper, newer options that stand a good chance at luring shoppers away from this device.</p><h2 id="Anker-USB-3-0-SuperSpeed-10-Port-Hub-vs-Anker-10-Port-60W-Data-Hub-with-7-USB-3-0-Ports-and-3-PowerIQ-Charging-Ports"><a href="#Anker-USB-3-0-SuperSpeed-10-Port-Hub-vs-Anker-10-Port-60W-Data-Hub-with-7-USB-3-0-Ports-and-3-PowerIQ-Charging-Ports" class="headerlink" title="Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub vs. Anker 10 Port 60W Data Hub with 7 USB 3.0 Ports and 3 PowerIQ Charging Ports"></a><strong>Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub vs. Anker 10 Port 60W Data Hub with 7 USB 3.0 Ports and 3 PowerIQ Charging Ports</strong></h2><p> One of the fiercest competitors to the Anker USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 10-Port Hub is Anker’s own 10 Port 60W Data Hub. This model, 2 years newer, features 7 data ports and 3 PowerIQ dedicated charging ports at 2.1A. The kicker? This model only costs $42.99, forcing shoppers to decide how badly they_really_ need those extra data ports. If you want to charge more than one device at a time at full speed, the newer 10 Port 60W Data Hub definitely has an advantage.</p><p> Interested in checking out more options?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Sometimes, we take a look at our cable internet bill and gasp—paying that extra $10 a month to rent a modem really adds up. That’s why devices like the Netgear C3700 are so important. At under $100, this modem can probably pay for itself in under a year while still providing the speeds we expect from our service (at least over a wired connection).</p><p> We got our hands on the Netgear C3700 for testing and put it through the wringer to see whether or not it’s worth your cash, and what kind of performance you can expect.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148774/18498" target="_top" id="2148774">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148774" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148774/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Small-and-inconspicuous"><a href="#Design-Small-and-inconspicuous" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small and inconspicuous"></a>Design: Small and inconspicuous</h2><p> With a device that packs<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-cable-modem-router-combos-to-buy-4082541" >both a cable modem and a wireless router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you might expect the Netgear C3700 to be a bulky device, but that’s not the case. It’s actually quite small, measuring just 7.6 inches high and weighing a scant 0.77 pounds. This, combined with the low-key black finish and lack of external antennas means that it won’t stick out, no matter where you put it.</p><p> This definitely works in the Netgear C3700’s favor.

We just unplugged our existing cable modem, plugged all the cables into this new one, and waited for the lights to turn on. Then all we had to do was phone our ISP to activate it.</p><p> To make things even easier, Netgear has included self-activation instructions for a number of major carriers so you can skip the phone bit. Through our Xfinity 250Mbps service, we simply went to the URL, printed on the instructions, signed in, and we were online.</p><p> Once everything is set up, you can go through the online management portal to change wireless settings. This is an optional step since the wireless network works right out of the box using the information printed on the side of the modem.</p><p> We weren’t impressed with the wireless performance, but the wired performance surprised us.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Everything-a-small-home-needs"><a href="#Connectivity-Everything-a-small-home-needs" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Everything a small home needs"></a>Connectivity: Everything a small home needs</h2><p> The Netgear C3700 is a modem-router combo, which means, hypothetically, it’s the only networking device many people will need. On top of the two Gigabit<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, you’re also getting dual antennas, which makes this a dual-band device (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz). It’s not the fastest wireless connection in the world, though—the Netgear C3700 is rated for N600 speeds, something we haven’t seen in a few years.</p><p> It is an 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 modem, meaning it’s capable of handling internet speeds up to 340 Mbps. But that N600 wireless speed means that devices on Wi-Fi won’t be that fast. If you have a really fast internet connection like we do, it might be best to use an external wireless router.</p><p> There is also a USB 2.0 port around the back where you can plug in a hard drive or a printer for network access.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Great-when-wired-but-wireless-speeds-lag"><a href="#Network-Performance-Great-when-wired-but-wireless-speeds-lag" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Great when wired, but wireless speeds lag"></a>Network Performance: Great when wired, but wireless speeds lag</h2><p> We didn’t exactly have high hopes for the C3700 and its N600 wireless rating. At its peak during testing, we reached wireless speeds of 130Mbps, but that didn’t last—with multiple devices connected and in use, we were seeing speeds as low as 40Mbps just a few feet away from the router.</p><p> We weren’t impressed with the wireless performance, but the wired performance surprised us. Even after connecting 13 devices to our network, we were able to get our advertised 250 Mbps speeds through a wired connection, and sometimes even higher.</p><p> Thankfully, this means that an attached router would be able to keep up, which is what we’d recommend. The wireless performance isn’t great and you’re going to have a much better experience with a separate router.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lPF7EXzNUljkXFySwthTmhwRbiY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-5-6-1c4a748dd9b644c39d8bd8c47180c74f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear C3700"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Bill Thomas</p><h2 id="Software-No-frills"><a href="#Software-No-frills" class="headerlink" title="Software: No frills"></a>Software: No frills</h2><p> We prefer a network backend that’s straight to the point, and that’s exactly what we got with the Netgear C3700.</p><p> The management portal is incredibly simple. Upon logging in, there are six tiles that you can click on to change settings like your wireless password, attached devices, and anything connected to the USB port. These tiles will also show you the status of your network at a glance: how many devices are attached, whether your cable connection is working, and even your network password.</p><p> We were able to click over into the “advanced” tab to gain access to more robust controls, but this shouldn’t be necessary for most users. Power users will probably appreciate the fine controls.</p><p> You can also download the Netgear Genie app on your phone, which allows you to manage your network from a more attractive interface. Much of the same functionality is here, but it might be a more approachable interface for those who don’t really know where to start with their router settings.</p><h2 id="Price-It-pays-for-itself"><a href="#Price-It-pays-for-itself" class="headerlink" title="Price: It pays for itself"></a>Price: It pays for itself</h2><p> The Netgear C3700 retails for $109.99, but you should be able to find it for less (as of the time of this writing, it’s on sale for about $95). At this price, the modem has a head start on paying for itself.</p><p> For an 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem with a lightweight router built in, this price is about par for the course. If you can find the Netgear C3700 for under $100, then it might be worth buying for the cable modem performance and pairing it with a solid wireless router.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043603/7443" target="_top" id="2043603">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043603" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043603/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-C3700-vs-Arris-Surfboard-SBG6700-AC"><a href="#Netgear-C3700-vs-Arris-Surfboard-SBG6700-AC" class="headerlink" title="Netgear C3700 vs. Arris Surfboard SBG6700-AC"></a>Netgear C3700 vs. Arris Surfboard SBG6700-AC</h2><p> The Arris Surfboard SBG6700-AC has the same 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable rating but ups the wireless support to AC1600 speeds. This still isn’t top-of-the-line wireless speed—and it is a bit more expensive at $119 MSRP—but that extra cash is worth the improved network performance. However, the Arris model does not have a USB 2.0 port for network-attached storage or printers.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A solid modem, but the poor wireless performance undermines its appeal as a combo device.</strong><br> The cable modem’s performance is great, but the wireless performance is just not there. If all you want is the cheapest possible modem with built-in dual-band Wi-Fi, then the Netgear C3700 checks those boxes. But we think you’re better off spending more for better performance or just buying two standalone devices.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/motorola-mg7700-review-4589346" >Motorola MG7700 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/netgear-nighthawk-c7000-review-4686068" >Netgear Nighthawk C7000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C3700 Cable Modem Router</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>Price  $109.99</li><li>Release Date  February 2014</li><li>Weight  0.77 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 4.45 x 1.63 in.</li><li>UPC  606449099089</li><li>Speed  N600</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  No</li><li>MU-MIMO  No</li><li>Number of Antennas  2</li><li>Number of Bands  2</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  2</li><li>Chipset  Broadcom BCM3383G</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-high-performance-screen-recorders-for-windows-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, High-Performance Screen Recorders for Windows Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-beginners-guide-to-visual-storytelling-key-shot-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Beginner’s Guide to Visual Storytelling Key Shot Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-the-key-to-attracting-views-youtube-image-marketing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Key to Attracting Views YouTube Image Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/customizing-your-iphone-with-dark-mode-features-users-manual/"><u>Customizing Your iPhone with Dark Mode Features: User's Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/fixing-the-dreaded-sos-on-iphone-a-guide-to-restore-full-functionality/"><u>Fixing the Dreaded 'SOS' On iPhone: A Guide to Restore Full Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/galaxy-s10plus-vs-s20-showdown-an-in-depth-comparison-and-review/"><u>Galaxy S10+ Vs.

It works on most cars made in the U.S. after 1996 or in the EU or Asia after 2000 and supports multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, Russian, and German. The large LCD has a white backlight to make it easy to read even in dim lighting.</p><p> If it turns out that your code isn’t serious, this device can turn off that annoying check engine light. The scanner comes with a 2.5-foot long, well-insulated cable that connects with your car’s OBDII data link connector; no other battery or charger is required as it powers up through that link. A three-year warranty means you can rest easy choosing this scanner.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> No |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> Yes |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.02”x6.34”x1.38” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 9.6 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >BlueDriver Professional OBDII Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/415766460" >$120 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works through a user-friendly app</li><li>Durable</li><li>Always stays plugged in</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> The BlueDriver OBDII Scanner isn’t the cheapest option out there, but seeing as it’s aimed at those who want more professional readings than you can get from all-in-one units, that’s to be expected. This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.</p><p> What’s extra interesting about this is the 24&#x2F;7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Yes |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> No |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.2”x1.9”x1” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.08 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Car Code Reader"></a>What to Look For in a Car Code Reader</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982499">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982499">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982499%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982499/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h3><p> If you haven’t had a car code reader before, purchase a simple one.

OBD2 is a universal interface in most cars introduced in the 1980s. While it won’t work on every old car out there, you should be covered as long as it is somewhat new. Almost all newer cars will support it.</li><li>Are car code readers worth it?<br> Car code readers are relatively inexpensive, making them a worthwhile investment if you want to pinpoint an issue with your vehicle without taking it to an expensive mechanic. A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/crafting-a-new-world-on-mars-building-cities-amidst-the-excitement-and-windy-weather/"><u>Crafting a New World on Mars - Building Cities Amidst the Excitement and Windy Weather</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/decoding-the-value-an-insightful-reveal-on-the-google-pixelbook-gos-exceptional-quality-and-higher-pricing/"><u>Decoding the Value: An Insightful Reveal on The Google Pixelbook Go's Exceptional Quality & Higher Pricing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/digital-darling-list-top-viewed-on-fb/"><u>Digital Darling List Top Viewed on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/discovering-the-best-in-budget-vr-gaming-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-oculus-quest-2/"><u>Discovering the Best in Budget VR Gaming: A Comprehensive Look at the Oculus Quest 2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/diy-upgrade-anticipating-gpt-4s-impact/"><u>DIY Upgrade: Anticipating GPT-4's Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/evaluating-jackery-powerbar-charging-solution-featuring-a-unique-inbuilt-ac-outlet/"><u>Evaluating Jackery PowerBar Charging Solution - Featuring a Unique Inbuilt AC Outlet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/evaluating-tp-links-ac1200-wi-fi-range-extender-re305-features-benefits-and-user-experiences/"><u>Evaluating TP-Link's AC1200 Wi-Fi Range Extender (RE305): Features, Benefits, and User Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/is-your-data-secure-with-chatgpts-privacy-measures/"><u>Is Your Data Secure with ChatGPT's Privacy Measures?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/leading-srs-tuning-methods-for-macwin-users-for-2024/"><u>Leading SRS Tuning Methods for Mac/Win Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/master-your-minds-library-utilize-mematic-for-2024/"><u>Master Your Mind's Library - Utilize Mematic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/scrutinizing-microsoft-and-blizzards-potential-alliance/"><u>Scrutinizing Microsoft and Blizzard's Potential Alliance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/secure-steps-for-skyrocketing-video-engagement-a-million-wins-strategy/"><u>Secure Steps for Skyrocketing Video Engagement A Million Wins Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/top-10-youtube-video-editing-tips-for-beginner-editors/"><u>Top 10 YouTube Video Editing Tips for Beginner Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlock-vivo-y36i-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlock Vivo Y36i Phone Password Without Factory Reset Full Guide Here</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 is designed to deliver high-performance features in a low-budget package; this model has a great range and a high-intensity LED display. Let’s take a closer look at some strengths and weaknesses to evaluate what kind of performance you can expect on the road.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068417/7443" target="_top" id="2068417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068417/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-bit-cheap"><a href="#Design-A-bit-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A bit cheap"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>A bit cheap</strong></h2><p> The S55 is palm-sized, about comparable in size and shape to most other radar detectors. The plastic material feels a bit cheaper than other radar detectors I’ve tested, though the control buttons worked well and felt long-lasting and I never had issues with them sticking. The Passport S55 comes with a very small windshield mount that’s functional, but you may want to consider an aftermarket mount. It’s minimal with small suction cups and I’m not confident it will last long. Luckily, the lightweight design of the S55 means it doesn’t need much to hold it in place.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display shows bright red text&#x2F;symbols for maximum visibility while driving. The S55 can show four signal strength meters at the same time, plus the numeric frequency of alerts. There’s also a dark mode that turns off the display but doesn’t disable the audio alert.</p><p> The speaker on this radar detector is very small, about a quarter-inch square, but the audio alerts are high volume. You can select between standard and loud tones. The SmartCord power cable for the S55 has a handy mute button on it so you don’t have to reach over the dash.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-installation"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-installation" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy installation"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy installation</strong></h2><p> The S55 is straightforward and easy to install. Simply stick the windshield mount in place and plug the SmartCord lighter adapter into your car’s DC cigarette lighter input. Plugging the modular jack into the S55 will automatically power on the radar detector and you can quickly customize settings for display brightness, detector sensitivity levels, and volume. Then you’re ready to hit the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135395/19272" target="_top" id="2135395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135395/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Impressive-detection"><a href="#Range-Impressive-detection" class="headerlink" title="Range: Impressive detection"></a><strong>Range: Impressive detection</strong></h2><p> The Passport S55 features Enhanced Radar Protection that delivers long-distance range for laser and radar bands, including K and Ka bands, widely used microwave frequencies for police radar guns. It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity. While testing the S55 in Highway mode I received Ka-band alerts over a mile and a half out from where I approached a highway patrol parked on the median of the interstate. This range was on par with much more expensive models.</p><p> It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity.</p><h2 id="Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced"><a href="#Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Not exactly enhanced"></a><strong>Performance: Not exactly enhanced</strong></h2><p> The S55 has different modes designed to adjust to specific frequency bands and sensitivity levels for city or highway driving. You can quickly customize the settings by using the included quick reference guide. You can also turn off specific frequency bands if they tend to give a lot of false alerts.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><p> In terms of false alerts, the AutoSensitivity feature didn’t really help in directing the overall high-sensitivity. This radar detector gave frequent false alerts from commercial door-openers and vehicle anti-collision warning systems. Unfortunately, the S55 lacks the advanced filters of more expensive models that help reduce the annoying frequency of false alerts.</p><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $128, the Passport S55 is a low-end radar detector priced accordingly. More advanced radar detectors can easily be several hundred dollars more expensive, and the S55 is a good deal if you plan to use it primarily on the highway. Door-openers along the city and commercial roads will frequently trigger false alerts. You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><p> You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><h2 id="Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector"><a href="#Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector" class="headerlink" title="Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector"></a><strong>Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector</strong></h2><p> A popular competitor brand to Escort that makes a wide selection of radar detectors is Uniden. The Uniden DFR9 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniden-DFR9-Detection-Cameras-Display/dp/B07F6PZXHM/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799949%7Cncd245a3f879640b69fbbb5e95c20e78e20%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a model that can be considered the next price tier above the S55. The DFR9’s MSRP is $300 but it can often be found on sale for about $270.</p><p> The DFR9 has an excellent detection range and a color LED display. The DFR9 also features GPS technology that filters out stationary false alerts, a welcome addition in mid-level radar detectors, and supports database access which alerts you to red light and speed camera locations.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A basic radar detector that’s ideal for beginners or anyone on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 has reliable long-range detection, but I found its performance and range of features to be pretty basic. This unit never missed the presence of parked police down the highway who appeared to be using radar guns, which means I’m confident in recommending this model for those on a budget. However, buyer beware that false alerts are an unavoidable inconvenience with this model.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Passport S55</li><li>Product Brand  Escort</li><li>SKU  B019HF60EI</li><li>Price  $189.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.6 x 3.75 x 1 in.</li><li>Warranty  Limited One Year Warranty</li><li>Display size  1&#x2F;4”H x 1 3&#x2F;4”L</li><li>Display type  280 LED Matrix&#x2F;Text</li><li>Radar receiver  Superheterodyne, Varactor-Tuned VCO, Scanning Frequency, Discriminator, Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</li><li>Power requirements  12 VDC, Negative Ground (car lighter&#x2F;accessory)</li><li>GPS  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-digital-diaries-with-complimentary-upgrades-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Digital Diaries with Complimentary Upgrades for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-unveiling-youtubes-earnings-for-1m-views/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiling YouTube's Earnings for 1M Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/5-advanced-chatbot-therapists-using-ai-to-tackle-mental-health-issues/"><u>5 Advanced Chatbot Therapists Using AI to Tackle Mental Health Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/all-about-usb-20-insights-into-data-velocity-cord-selection-and-attachment-options/"><u>All About USB 2.0: Insights Into Data Velocity, Cord Selection, and Attachment Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/examining-the-value-of-5g-in-the-lg-k92-not-justifying-its-hype/"><u>Examining the Value of 5G in the LG K92 - Not Justifying Its Hype</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exceptional-audio-quality-of-a35/"><u>Exceptional Audio Quality of A35</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/experience-seamless-connectivity-with-amplifi-hd-wireless-mesh-network-say-goodbye-to-weak-signals/"><u>Experience Seamless Connectivity with Amplifi HD Wireless Mesh Network – Say Goodbye to Weak Signals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/expert-picks-leading-body-cameras-innovations/"><u>Expert Picks: Leading Body Cameras Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/explore-advanced-features-combining-chatgpts-capabilities-with-wolfram-technology/"><u>Explore Advanced Features: Combining ChatGPT's Capabilities with Wolfram Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/frontiersmans-elite-tripod-compendium/"><u>Frontiersman's Elite Tripod Compendium</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/harmonic-frames-filming-music-tracks-using-iphones-for-2024/"><u>Harmonic Frames Filming Music Tracks Using iPhones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/latest-trends-in-mobile-viewing-android-edition-vr360-for-2024/"><u>Latest Trends in Mobile Viewing - Android Edition (VR/360) for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Although it has fewer features than its bigger sibling, the Versa Special Edition, the new Versa Lite Edition is a powerful tool for tracking your exercise progress and monitoring your wellness.</p><p> With an attractive price point to match it’s confident smartwatch identity, the Versa Lite succeeds at combining affordability and function, striking a fine balance between being a little computer on your wrist and a delimited fitness tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A3jXmqXMfkFi3FKj8NYHxxYKi84=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-03-849db13f6309480cb88c9d05e512f1a1.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Design-Customizable-and-instinctive"><a href="#Design-Customizable-and-instinctive" class="headerlink" title="Design: Customizable and instinctive"></a><strong>Design: Customizable and instinctive</strong></h2><p> With a host of different color options, wristbands, and downloadable clock faces, the Fitbit Versa Lite is a stylish digital watch that’s ready to be customized.

The unit is thoroughly water-resistant, making a day at the ocean or laps at the pool no cause for worry.</p><p> Measuring about 1.5 by 1.5 inches, the touchscreen is easy to wake at any time with the innate ‘screen wake’ feature. If you prefer, you can easily modify the settings to only wake when you press the side button or touch the screen, or you can set it to stay on continually.</p><p> With a host of different color options, wristbands, and downloadable clock faces, the Fitbit Versa Lite is a stylish digital watch that’s ready to be customized.</p><p> The Fitbit OS has an intuitive interface and is easy to navigate. Helpful screen prompts pop up when you enter and exit various modes. There’s also a pause button, which is convenient for any mid-workout pit stops that would otherwise affect your stats.</p><p> Touch and swipe commands are easy and effective, even with sweaty fingers.

The Fitbit app is available for both iOS and Android platforms, and syncing it to the Versa Lite via Bluetooth is very straightforward.</p><p> When you connect your watch to the app the first time, the touchscreen guides you through a series of “Quick Tips” to get you acquainted with the Versa Lite’s layout. The whole process takes about 10 minutes and then you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BD_8kRJ7n6qQdf5LY9rLKiYigTQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-05-fac178f5e6b240c29ff8d1e1e4fcb96f.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability"><a href="#Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability"></a><strong>Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite feels nice in your hands and on your wrist. The device is relatively lightweight at 1.41 ounces and the screen unit sits naturally on the back of your wrist. The Versa Lite comes with two wristbands, one small and one large, measuring four and 5.25 inches long. Both are a little less than an inch wide and are made of a smooth, soft polymer material which is very comfortable for extended periods of wear.</p><p> Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed.</p><p> Aesthetically, the Versa Lite’s screen and wrist band are attractive and look sleek. You can confidently wear the Versa Lite in any professional setting—it’s good-looking but not overly flashy. Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed and you might find yourself wanting to leave it on the bedside table instead.</p><h2 id="Performance-Lean-and-effective"><a href="#Performance-Lean-and-effective" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Lean and effective"></a><strong>Performance: Lean and effective</strong></h2><p> The Versa Lite uses an optical heart rate monitor which applies photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure your pulse and gauge your heart rate. This feature shines a rapidly-pulsating LED into your skin and measures how your blood flow affects the dispersion of light, producing a constant stream of heart rate data.</p><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite also has sleep monitoring features, so if you choose to sleep in the watch, the Fitbit app will be able to tell how much time you spend in light, deep, and REM stages as well as more accurately measure your resting heart rate. This is especially useful for rigorous exercise training, such as training to race a marathon or set a PR. Sleep tracking is activated by a combination of complete rest and changes in your heart rates patterns, known as heart rate variability (HRV).</p><p> Despite lacking the extra bells and whistles of Fitbit’s more advanced models (such as Fitbit Pay and music storage capabilities), the Versa Lite has all the features any walker, runner, biker, swimmer, weightlifter, or fitness enthusiast will want for goal-setting and training. It does have a few smartwatch features like a weather app and call and text notifications, as well as the Strava fitness app. But it does not have cellular connectivity on its own, and can only display notifications when connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth.</p><p> Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit.</p><p> The GPS capabilities of the Versa Lite are limited in a similar way. The smartwatch does not have full GPS capabilities, so it approximates your distance and pace by measuring your stride length with its built-in step counting technology. If you want this data to be relatively accurate, you’ll have to take your phone along with you so the watch can use what Fitbit calls “connected GPS” to access your smartphone’s GPS signal. Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit compared to the data our other GPS-capable watches collected.</p><p> The Versa Lite has specific modes for running, biking, swimming, walking, treadmill workouts, weight lifting, and interval workouts. These exercise apps chart your workouts and allow you to customize a real-time display of your stats in order to get you the updates you want in the middle of your workout. For instance, the Versa Lite can notify you at predetermined ‘lap’ distances (such as mile intervals) to give you your average mile pace while in “Run” or “Walk” mode. You can easily customize these different stats in the exercise app settings.</p><p> The Versa Lite is water-resistant and rated at a depth of 50 meters, so you can swim with it on and take advantage of its swim mode exercise app. The swimming app brings up one of the flaws we found with our particular Versa Lite: it wouldn’t turn off! There are recent reports on the Fitbit.com forum of some users encountering a strange phenomenon where the swim mode won’t stop when you press the pause and finish buttons.</p><p> It is unclear how many users are affected by this glitch (it seems other users are unaffected) but we experienced it with the Versa Lite Edition we tested. The only way for us to exit the swim exercise app was to hold down the side button for about 10 seconds in order to escape with the factory power cycle feature. This was one of the only significant flaws we found with the Versa Lite, but it did mean that all data for the swim workout was lost after restarting the Fitbit. This essentially rendered the swim mode unusable on our unit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/97XADSG__Ti-9y6W9YfT6A-sRLg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-04-a5baf62c5de749cb93986be2eab3ad2d.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135357/19272" target="_top" id="2135357">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135357" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135357/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Days-of-activity"><a href="#Battery-Life-Days-of-activity" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Days of activity"></a><strong>Battery Life: Days of activity</strong></h2><p> Fitbit promised four or more days of battery life for the Versa Lite, and they weren’t lying. The Versa Lite we tested lasted almost four and a half days before draining all the way down to zero. This made so many days of daily wear and daily runs seem hassle-free.</p><p> It also charged back up to 100% in just about two hours—for a device that gives you a range of stats, this speedy battery top-up means the fitness freaks among us won’t have to sacrifice too much time away from our metrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NkHZ0M514IlrqowHF6M_QWHxgj8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-06-be4c149f1dff4214acfe0fbc3a4d63e6-1-f6f110eb54e142c992dd3f613bdb9f28.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Key-Features-Fitbit-basics-plus-apps-for-any-activity"><a href="#Key-Features-Fitbit-basics-plus-apps-for-any-activity" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: Fitbit basics plus apps for any activity"></a><strong>Key Features: Fitbit basics plus apps for any activity</strong></h2><p> Like all Fitbits, the Versa Lite keeps track of what the company calls their “Fitbit basics.” These are key activity metrics for any active lifestyle and make it super easy for you to keep track of your health and get motivated.</p><p> The Fitbit basics have their own section on the Versa Lite, separate from the other apps, and they show you what you’ve accomplished for the day. These stats include daily step count, total distance covered for the day, daily calorie consumption, active minutes for each day, and a Saturday through Friday graph of your average daily steps.</p><p> A host of other smartwatch apps come standard with the Versa Lite, including alarms, a weather app, a stopwatch, a relaxation app that guides you through short mindfulness exercises, and the specific exercise apps mentioned above. As far as additional apps for the Versa Lite, this is it—the Lite Edition does not have the ability to add extra apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016129/19272" target="_top" id="2016129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016129/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-deal-for-under-200"><a href="#Price-A-deal-for-under-200" class="headerlink" title="Price: A deal for under $200"></a><strong>Price: A deal for under $200</strong></h2><p> Retailing for $159.95 and occasionally selling for less on sale, the Versa Lite is a price-conscious but solid piece of tech that prioritizes exercise.

Relying heavily on the Fitbit app for its design and integration, the Versa Lite is focused on delivering a targeted dashboard of stats for its users, including Fitbit’s core stats like step counting and calorie counting.</p><p> The new Apple Watch on the other hand, as per Apple’s brand identity, is more geared to synchronizing and integrating with the lives, apps, and products of those already accustomed to the iPhone and Mac brand. In addition to this, Apple’s new Series 4 watches have been redesigned with wellness monitoring features like heart rate tracking and step counting.</p><p> The Apple Watch carries a heftier price tag at $399 (MSRP) without cellular connectivity. If you are not already hooked on the Mac lifestyle or love to accessorize your digital life with apps, the Fitbit Versa Lite should be a worthy consideration for anyone looking to get a quality fitness tracker and well made first-tier smartwatch.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An adept and affordable fitness tracking smartwatch for those who want to keep it simple.</strong></p><p> Though we can’t recommend this watch to swimmers (pending a potential software solution for that glitch), the Fitbit Versa Lite is a great way to chart your progress throughout a training program or competitive season. The combination of the Fitbit Basics and dedicated exercise apps makes this watch both an insightful wellness monitor for everyday activity and a great tool for tracking your fitness progress.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/garmin-forerunner-945-review-4768586" >Garmin Forerunner 945 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-inspire-hr-review-4768656" >Fitbit Inspire HR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-review-4766873" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Versa Lite</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>MPN  FB415</li><li>Price  $159.95</li><li>Weight  1.41 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android, Windows 10</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth 4.0, Bluetooth LE</li><li>Battery  1 x lithium polymer battery (included)</li><li>Battery capacity  Up to 4 days</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Display  LCD touchscreen</li><li>Heart Rate Monitor  Yes</li><li>Memory Capacity  7 days of activity data, 30 days of daily totals</li><li>What’s included  Fitbit Versa Lite Edition watch, small wrist band, large wrist band, USB charging cradle</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/ensuring-authenticity-how-nightshade-can-help-safeguard-your-art-from-ai-replication/"><u>Ensuring Authenticity: How Nightshade Can Help Safeguard Your Art From AI Replication</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/experience-firsthand-the-innovation-behind-the-new-ampace-andes-1500-stationary-battery/"><u>Experience Firsthand the Innovation Behind the New Ampacē Andes 1500 Stationary Battery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-xiaomi-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Amplifi HD is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mesh-wi-fi-network-systems-4139748" >Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a main router and separate mesh points that serve as satellite routers. The Amplifi system is supposed to extend Wi-Fi range, reduce dead zones, and provide better coverage. To see how Ubiquiti’s mesh system holds up to the demands of a household with multiple devices, I connected the Amplifi HD in my test home that contains roughly 50 Wi-Fi connected devices.</p><h2 id="Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points"><a href="#Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points" class="headerlink" title="Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points"></a><strong>Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD Mesh System comes with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >long-range router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and two satellite mesh points. The router has a unique design. It’s small, cube-shaped, and it looks more like an alarm clock or smart display than a router. It doesn’t have antennas protruding from it as you see on most routers.</p><p> The router measures 3.9 inches by 3.9 inches and its matte white with an LCD touchscreen and a light around the bottom perimeter. The router is stylish, yet unassuming. You can set it on a table or entertainment center, and it’ll go unnoticed.</p><p> The two satellite points are very simplistic. They are basic looking, oval-shaped devices with no ports. They plug into a wall outlet, and they have indicator lights to tell you the signal strength. The mesh points, aside from being the same matte-white color, don’t match very well with the main router. Fortunately, they sit in different areas of the home, so the mismatched design doesn’t have too much impact on the overall aesthetic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s87ZCkRIGWmpbjF2kUOXJRQtOl4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_02-1a111a806ad7495ba9f36d51121fe5b0.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier"><a href="#Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Couldn’t get any easier"></a><strong>Setup: Couldn’t get any easier</strong></h2><p> The setup for the Amplifi HD system is probably the easiest setup process I’ve encountered. The app walks you through the process step-by-step, with pictures to guide you on each instruction. The most difficult part was deciding where to place the two mesh points in my test home. I placed one in the far bedroom and one in my office, two rooms that notoriously experience drop-offs.</p><p> By default, the app creates a dual (2.4 and 5Ghz) network, which directs traffic based on the most efficient pathways. You can create separate 2.4 and 5Ghz networks, or make other adjustments as you see fit though. You can change the band on the mesh points (from 2.4 to 5Ghz), create additional SSIDs, and more. For the purpose of testing, I used the default combined network and allowed the system to direct network traffic between bands.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices"><a href="#Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices"></a><strong>Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system is not Wi-Fi 6 capable.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553" >It has 802.11ac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s backwards compatible. On the back of the router sit four gigabit LAN ports in addition to the WAN connection. There’s no multigig port, but the four ports were a welcome addition.</p><p> The Amplifi HD seems to be designed for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >optimal signal range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as opposed to device quantity. This is an ideal system for someone with a large area to cover, but it’s not a powerhouse capable of managing an army of devices like the Nighthawk AX12 or the TP-Link Archer AX6000. The Amplifi system thrives in terms of its ability to push a signal over a long distance, as it can cover areas up to 20,000 square feet. The Amplifi system doesn’t exactly thrive in its ability to manage dozens of devices simultaneously.</p><p> In my test home, speeds from my ISP max out at 500 Mbps. In the same room as the main router, Ookla measured the speed at 131 Mbps. The speed remained consistent throughout the home, even in rooms that typically experience drop offs with other routers. However, outside in the backyard, the speed reduced to 111 Mbps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130886/7443" target="_top" id="2130886">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130886" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130886/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-A-display-screen"><a href="#Key-Features-A-display-screen" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A display screen"></a><strong>Key Features: A display screen</strong></h2><p> The touchscreen on the front of the main router can display the time, total GB, WAN and Router IP addresses, internet speeds, and port statuses.

But, the Amplifi system’s design, easy setup, and feature set help justify the price.</p><h2 id="Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> A Nest Wi-Fi package sells for around the same price as the Amplifi system. However, with the Nest system, all of the components match, while the Amplifi router looks very different from its mesh points. The Nest system points also serve as Google Assistant speakers, and the system features some more advanced technologies (like WPA3 encryption). However, one big issue with the Nest system is that it only has two Ethernet ports, while the Amplifi router has four spare ports.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Looks better than it performs.</strong></p><p> The Amplifi HD mesh system is attractive and does provide coverage for a huge area, but it doesn’t deliver lightning-fast speeds in a home with dozens of connected devices.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Amplifi HD Mesh Wi-Fi System</li><li>Product Brand  Ubiquiti</li><li>Price  $340.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.9 x 3.9 x 3.9 in.</li><li>Aggregate Speed  5.25 Gbps</li><li>Security  WPA2</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Wi-Fi standards  802.11ac</li><li>MIMO  3 x 3</li><li>IPv6 compatible  Yes</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  4 Gigabit LAN ports</li><li>Range  20,000 square feet</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li><li>Remote connect  Yes</li><li>What’s included  Amplifi HD Router, two mesh points, power and Ethernet cables, guides</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-charting-a-course-to-riches-youtubes-monetary-milestones/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Charting a Course to Riches YouTube's Monetary Milestones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-turn-zip-into-srt-a-step-by-step-conversion-process/"><u>2024 Approved Turn ZIP Into SRT A Step-by-Step Conversion Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-thermopro-tp67-thermometer-is-it-worth-the-investment/"><u>Affordable ThermoPro TP67 Thermometer - Is It Worth the Investment?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/breaking-news-exposing-the-newest-twitter-deception-tactics-launch-of-metas-authentication-system-and-in-depth-analysis-of-ai-powerhouse-chatgpt-4/"><u>Breaking News: Exposing the Newest Twitter Deception Tactics, Launch of Meta's Authentication System & In-Depth Analysis of AI Powerhouse ChatGPT-4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/easy-setup-getting-epson-wf-2750-printer-drivers-installed-on-your-computer/"><u>Easy Setup: Getting Epson WF-2750 Printer Drivers Installed on Your Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/expert-insights-on-the-xp-pen-artist-16-professional-sketchpad-analysis/"><u>Expert Insights on the XP-Pen Artist 16 Professional Sketchpad Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/experts-weigh-in-a-comprehensive-evaluation-of-third-gen-apple-tv-4k/"><u>Experts Weigh In: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Third Gen Apple TV 4K</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/innovating-interaction-tomorrows-ai-evolution/"><u>Innovating Interaction: Tomorrow's AI Evolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/kid-friendly-nickwatch-premieres-in-america-on-kids-choice-awards-night/"><u>Kid-Friendly NickWatch Premieres in America on Kids' Choice Awards Night</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/overcooked-2-game-analysis-a-taste-of-chaotic-cuisine/"><u>Overcooked! 2 Game Analysis: A Taste of Chaotic Cuisine</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/score-big-deals-premium-bargains-on-benq-monitors-and-projectors-for-prime-shoppers/"><u>Score Big Deals: Premium Bargains on BenQ Monitors & Projectors for Prime Shoppers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As much as I love my gaming laptops, both of my models, an Eluktronics and an MSI, both feel like they’re about to catch fire whenever I’m playing a heavy-hitting game like Division or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/destiny-2-4158011" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> A couple gaming sessions later, and I realized I needed a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptop-cooling-pads-4149823" >laptop cooling pad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After taking a look at various models, I decided to try out the HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad. It boasts five fans and an adjustable rollout switch to customize my cooling experience. And it offers anti-slip baffles so my curious cat can’t knock it off my laptop. After over a year of use, I still use this almost every day for my gaming needs. Read on for our final verdict, as well as thoughts on its specs.</p><h2 id="Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad"><a href="#Design-Looks-like-a-gamer’s-cooling-pad" class="headerlink" title="Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad"></a>Design: Looks like a gamer’s cooling pad</h2><p> HAVIT offers this laptop cooling pad in two different colors: red and blue. I personally felt that the red would be too bright and opted for the blue; when I pulled it out of the box, I was surprised at how heavy its 1.8 pounds felt in my hand.</p><p> On top of the pad itself, it comes with a braided USB cord for protection. It could plug into one of two ports, of which I used the spare to add USB charging for USB compatible items like my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-kindle-2019-review-4688850" >Amazon Kindle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jabra-talk-45-review-5070286" >Java Bluetooth headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/J6RTKS-ZdzNqPyF_Tm9lloOF1iM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_04-5a7071fefb884ba19eb68638fdbf1b2b.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust. If you’re looking for a simple design, this is not your cooling pad. That being said, the metal mesh pad for air circulation can accommodate laptops ranging from 14 to 17 inches thanks to its 15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 inches (LWH) in dimension.</p><h2 id="Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away"><a href="#Fans-Wasn’t-blown-away" class="headerlink" title="Fans: Wasn’t blown away"></a>Fans: Wasn’t blown away</h2><p> I set up the cooling pad and flipped on the roller switch. HAVIT promises five quiet fans—one 110-millimeter fan, and four other strategically placed 85-millimeter fans. HAVIT holds true to its promise: This cooling pad emits a fairly faint sound I can’t hear through my Samsung Buds headphones, even with their noise cancelling features. The fans are so quiet that if I was gaming, I wasn’t able to hear them.</p><p> Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees.</p><p> Better yet, I could adjust the fans to customize how much air I wanted to circulate due to the roller switch HAVIT put as the on&#x2F;off switch. If I wasn’t sure about how much power I was putting into the fans, I could simply lift my laptop up from the pad; as I turned up the power, the blue LED lights in the cooling pad grew brighter.</p><p> Before getting this cooling pad, my Eluktronics laptop sounded like an airplane was taking off and landing at my desk space. I wish I could say that this changed after implementing the pad into my gaming rig, or even with my MSI laptop. Unfortunately, my laptops’ fans still sound like I’m on the tarmac instead of being at home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/l2nDOOm1dGSmniJBqJPn708DnK8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_03-71babed64c14425184604e4825680aac.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> That’s not to say that this laptop cooling pad doesn’t help cool it down. Since my Eluktronics is getting some much-needed TLC in the shop, I tested the MSI’s internal temps while running<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tropico-6-review-5077604" >Tropico Six <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on my laptop. Without the laptop cooling pad, I was running around 187 degrees Fahrenheit. With the cooling pad, it adjusted to around 169 degrees. It’s not much, but it’s enough to make a difference.</p><h2 id="Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing"><a href="#Baffles-Adjustable-for-gaming-and-typing" class="headerlink" title="Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing"></a>Baffles: Adjustable for gaming and typing</h2><p> If you feel the laptop needs more circulation, the good news is that HAVIT also anticipated these needs, too. Anti-slip baffles offer a sturdy position on any desk, even if you push up the height to a more angled position.</p><p> There is a sturdy flap should you prefer the angled laptop pad, or if you prefer, a sturdier laptop placement while flat. I tested out the height adjustment for a little while, but ultimately decided against using them for personal preference instead of durability reasons.</p><p> To me, the design seems a little clunky. It has smooth edges, but it’s clearly designed as a gamer’s edgy laptop cooling pad with seemingly unnecessary grooves that serve only to hold dust.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hXjExslBR5KBA1RSMPFlkkvF1uQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_02-f065f40118184391b6f1ba1bffa763bd.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> And, if you’re on-the-go and travelling, the HAVIT 5 also packs quite nicely into a suitcase. Be sure to play it safe like I did and pack it around clothes. But if you need to go across country and want to take your gaming laptop with you, this is a good one that will hold up well in luggage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075472/7443" target="_top" id="2075472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075472/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Ouch"><a href="#Price-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Price: Ouch"></a>Price: Ouch</h2><p> I picked up my HAVIT 5 while it was on sale for around $30 back in 2019, but the usual price is around $50. That seems a little steep, especially for fans that don’t necessarily pack the punch for gaming that most laptops require. If you keep an eye on Amazon, you can usually get this one for around $30, as it seems to go on sale fairly often.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lItC7F6Ja8RbBfTaNXh5l9ufFqY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HAVIT_5_Laptop_Pad_05-07577b69f7d04de5a7904e798681ba02-6b3615a38d584594b89077eaf51228b2.jpg"                      alt="HAVIT 5 Gaming Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068440/7443" target="_top" id="2068440">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068440" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068440/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad"><a href="#HAVIT-5-vs-Kootak-Laptop-Cooling-Pad" class="headerlink" title="HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad"></a>HAVIT 5 vs. Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad</h2><p> It makes sense to compare the Kootak Laptop Cooling Pad to the HAVIT. Both have five cooling fans, both fit laptops up to 17 inches, and both offer anti-slip baffles to ensure your laptop is safe if you want to adjust the height for more air circulation or wrist angle preferences. The key differences are design and adjustability.</p><p> While the HAVIT is clearly a gaming laptop cooling pad, the Kootak features smooth edges and has a more universal aesthetic to its design. The Kootak is also cheaper, at around $37. If you prefer a true gaming cooling pad, go with the HAVIT. If you don’t care about aesthetics and prefer to be cost conscious, the Kootak will be better suited to your needs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Good, but could be great.</strong></p><p> It’s not the best out there, but so long as it cools the internal laptop core temperatures by about 20 degrees, it’s a worthy investment. Props go to HAVIT for giving it a roller switch for ultimate adjustability and an LED light that will show how high the fans are blowing. The fans could be stronger, but quieter fans over more power is preferable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/urban-armor-gear-macbook-pro-case-review-4689954" >Urban Armor Gear MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975816/19272" target="_top" id="1975816">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975816" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975816/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  5 Fan Laptop Cooler</li><li>Product Brand  HAVIT</li><li>MPN  HV-F2068</li><li>Price  $50.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2017</li><li>Weight  1.8 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15.87 x 11.81 x 1.34 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Voltage  5V</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Connectivity Options  USB port (one cord included)</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-fiscal-footprint-of-mr-beast-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Fiscal Footprint of Mr. Beast for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-integrating-songs-in-microsofts-presentation-maker-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Integrating Songs in Microsoft's Presentation Maker for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/add-radial-blur-effect-to-photos-in-photoshop-for-2024/"><u>Add Radial Blur Effect to Photos in Photoshop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-vivo-y100-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Vivo Y100 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-google-assistant-on-your-lock-screen-of-oneplus-nord-n30-5g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Use Google Assistant on Your Lock Screen Of OnePlus Nord N30 5G Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/improve-chromes-velocity-effortlessly-tips-for-a-smoother-experience/"><u>Improve Chrome's Velocity Effortlessly -

Read on for their full take.</em></p><p> An<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >ultrabook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is typically a thing of compromises, and if you want a laptop that’s thin and light, power is often sacrificed. However, the Razer Book 13 challenges that stereotype and offers a sleek and attractive alternative to other high-end<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-lightweight-laptops-to-buy-4065134" >ultra-portables <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . I tested it for 40 hours to find if it can live up both to its stunning ultrabook looks and Razer’s prowess in building high-powered gaming laptops.</p><h2 id="Design-Beauty-in-minimalism"><a href="#Design-Beauty-in-minimalism" class="headerlink" title="Design: Beauty in minimalism"></a>Design: Beauty in minimalism</h2><p> Razer is known for their flashy gaming-focused laptops, mice, and keyboards that are clearly marketed towards gamers, but they have always also employed a certain degree of restraint over some more exuberant gaming products. With the Book 13, that restraint is pushed even further with only a few tasteful reminders of the laptop’s gaming heritage—the twisted snaky Razer logo on the top, and of course RGB backlighting for the keyboard.</p><p> Though you can make the RGB as garish as you like, it’s completely customizable so you could make it a simple white backlight if you so desire. I particularly appreciated that when the Fn key is pressed, the corresponding keys light up and differentiate themselves from the rest of the keyboard. It’s a small touch, but it’s something I found myself missing when using other keyboards.</p><p> The overall build quality is just fantastic, as the Book 13 feels solid and robust and is built to last.</p><p> The keyboard itself has white keys on a silver aluminum background with speaker grilles to either side. It offers a great typing experience that is both comfortable and effective. The trackpad is similarly great, being expansive and accurate, and I found that it easily stands up to the level of quality set by Apple and Dell.</p><p> For such a thin laptop, there’s a surprising amount of ports included with the Book 13.</p><p> The overall build quality is just fantastic, as the Book 13 feels solid and robust and is built to last. The screen hinge is solid as a rock, yet smooth to operate. My only complaint might be that the soft edging around the screen’s bezel might not be as long-lasting as the rest of the laptop, though it’s hardly a critical component. I noticed some wear, particularly at the indent where you open the laptop, after just a month of use.</p><p> For such a thin laptop, there’s a surprising amount of ports included with the Book 13. You get 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a USB type-A port,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a microSD slot, and a 3.5mm headphone&#x2F;microphone combo port. Such a versatile array of inputs is not to be taken for granted these days, and is a big point in the Book 13’s favor.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148775/18498" target="_top" id="2148775">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148775" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148775/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Very-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Very-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Very straightforward"></a>Setup Process: Very straightforward</h2><p> There’s not a lot to say about setting up the Razer Book 13. It’s just a standard install of Windows 10 Home with no surprises along the way so you can be up and running in just a few minutes.</p><h2 id="Display-Positively-stunning"><a href="#Display-Positively-stunning" class="headerlink" title="Display: Positively stunning"></a>Display: Positively stunning</h2><p> The Razer Book 13 configuration we tested comes with an absolutely gorgeous 13.5-inch UHD 60Hz display that is both very color accurate and provides stunning visuals. This is great for both creative tasks that require color accuracy, and for media consumption. The 16:10 aspect ratio is definitely tailored for productivity. The bezel is attractively thin, and the screen is made of Gorilla Glass 6, making it highly scratch resistant.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C308jEtLYxnwMp68uF5Sd-2hjyA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Razer_Book13_02-4da7b450ac1c4b879f1b0bebfa9815b5.jpg"                      alt="Razer Book 13"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Performance-Lean-and-mean"><a href="#Performance-Lean-and-mean" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Lean and mean"></a>Performance: Lean and mean</h2><p> The Razer Book 13 surprised me by how much power it has despite the fact it doesn’t have a dedicated graphics card. It’s a great machine for photo editing, light video editing, and other creative tasks, and is even a reasonably capable gaming machine. Inside you’ll find an Intel Core i7-1165G7 processor and 16GB of RAM.</p><p> It’s a great machine for photo editing, light video editing, and other creative tasks.</p><p> These produced a GFX bench score of 14,256, which while not insane by gaming PC standards, is more than you’d expect from an integrated GPU. In PC Mark 10, it achieved a score of 4,608, which is certainly respectable.</p><p> I was able to play Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel at low settings and have a consistent experience, and in DOTA 2 I was able to max the graphics settings out if I bumped the resolution down to 1080p. This makes the Book 13 perfectly capable for competitive games, and even some AAA titles if you don’t mind dropping the settings down. For such a stylish, compact laptop this is truly impressive.</p><p> The Book 13 is equipped with a 512GB SSD. This is good enough, but it would have been nice to have a full terabyte of storage.</p><h2 id="Software-No-bloat"><a href="#Software-No-bloat" class="headerlink" title="Software: No bloat"></a>Software: No bloat</h2><p> I’m pleased to report that the Book 13 is pretty much free of bloat. Aside from the usual bits and bobs you get with Windows 10 Home, the laptop does come with Razer Synapse installed, which is absolutely essential as it allows you to control the customizable RGB backlighting in the keyboard, among a few other useful functions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hKfA1c1e0-bRVVhMU22PtI2GewM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Razer_Book13_03-23b08f335541443ebe1e7d7763140eca.jpg"                      alt="Razer Book 13"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Connectivity-The-latest-and-greatest"><a href="#Connectivity-The-latest-and-greatest" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: The latest and greatest"></a>Connectivity: The latest and greatest</h2><p> With<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Book 13 had no trouble taking full advantage of my home network. It provides a fast and reliable connection, and Bluetooth 5.0 is available as well.</p><h2 id="Battery-Juice-for-the-day"><a href="#Battery-Juice-for-the-day" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Juice for the day"></a>Battery: Juice for the day</h2><p> Razer claims a battery life of up to 10 hours or even a bit more, and I found this to be accurate. The Book 13 should get you through a day at the office without needing to recharge, depending upon use, of course.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6yYQ1e8vR0Ldvs2GP61CrvFy3zg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Razer_Book13_05-1c8a8e1bdd78413fb72cc6307a07ea40.jpg"                      alt="Razer Book 13"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Big-sound-for-a-small-laptop"><a href="#Audio-Big-sound-for-a-small-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Big sound for a small laptop"></a>Audio: Big sound for a small laptop</h2><p> You wouldn’t expect to get good audio out of such a small laptop, but the Book 13 does quite well in this regard. It features THX spatial audio and delivers a remarkably good listening experience. It’s certainly loud enough to deliver sound at max volume without noticeable distortion. 2Cellos cover of “Thunderstruck” is my go-to song for testing speakers and headphones, and I also listened to their new cover of “Livin’ on a Prayer.” The Book 13 rendered them both beautifully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/PL2MokPWQ_egcxv3fE0tw_k09Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Razer_Book13_04-6eed60095cbe467c9552c651ba4c9d46.jpg"                      alt="Razer Book 13"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> It’s particularly good in the mids and highs, but as you’d expect, loses something in the bass range. However, it’s more than adequate for listening to music, gaming, or watching movies.</p><h2 id="Camera-Competent-webcam"><a href="#Camera-Competent-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Camera: Competent webcam"></a>Camera: Competent webcam</h2><p> The webcam on the Book 13 is about average for a laptop. It captures 720p video and is perfectly acceptable, though not exceptional in any way. Video quality looks decent, even in relatively challenging situations.</p><h2 id="Price-The-cost-of-quality"><a href="#Price-The-cost-of-quality" class="headerlink" title="Price: The cost of quality"></a>Price: The cost of quality</h2><p> The configuration of the Razer Book 13 I tested is definitely pricey at $2,000. That’s a decent chunk of change, and you could certainly buy a laptop with more graphical power for the money, but the Book 13 isn’t made for high-end gaming.</p><p> Between its solid design, attractive aesthetics, and nice little touches that tie the whole package together, this is one awesome little ultrabook.</p><p> This is a premium, ultra-portable device designed more for professional work, and its ability to game is basically a nice bonus. Considering the competition from Dell and Apple, it’s not unreasonably priced.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151894/7443" target="_top" id="2151894">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151894" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151894/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Razer-Book-13-vs-Dell-XPS-13-7390-2-in-1"><a href="#Razer-Book-13-vs-Dell-XPS-13-7390-2-in-1" class="headerlink" title="Razer Book 13 vs. Dell XPS 13 7390 2-in-1"></a>Razer Book 13 vs. Dell XPS 13 7390 2-in-1</h2><p> There are a few big competitors that the Razer Book 13 is going up against, and perhaps the most significant is the excellent Dell XPS 13 7390 2-in-1. Dell’s XPS laptops are great, and the 13 2-in-1 is no exception. Its main advantage over the Razer is its ability to transform into a tablet, but the Razer wins over in terms of raw power, and of course the Book 13 features that wonderful RGB backlighting.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-7390-2-in-1-review-5113106" >Dell XPS 13 7390 2-in-1 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A laptop with great looks, compact design, and remarkable power.</strong></p><p> There’s a lot to love about the Razer Book 13, and not a lot of negative things to say about it. It’s not a graphical powerhouse, but the fact that it’s able to game at all is remarkable. Between its solid design, attractive aesthetics, and nice little touches that tie the whole package together, this is one awesome little ultrabook.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master finds an interesting balance between barebones manual flashes that sell for around half the price, and much more expensive options from big brands like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-new-canon-cameras-493499" >Canon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Nikon. The big upgrade is full radio control, letting you adjust a group of these lights in concert. Along with 24-105mm zoom support and a quick 3-second recycle time, this is a very appealing flash for off-camera use for portrait and real estate photographers.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Punching-above-the-price-point"><a href="#Design-Punching-above-the-price-point" class="headerlink" title="Design: Punching above the price point"></a><strong>Design: Punching above the price point</strong></h2><p> The Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master features a robust design that doesn’t feel like the manufacturer skimped on build quality — one of our biggest concerns with budget-minded flashes like this. When adjusting the position of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/using-the-dslr-pop-up-flash-492975" >flash head <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through its 90 degrees of vertical and 270 degrees of horizontal range, it felt very solid.</p><p> Buyers that need a lot of manual control for complex flash setups will be very pleased with what the get for the approximately $60 the YN560 IV costs.</p><p> Starting with the front of the device, you’ll find the photosensitive trigger sensors and the 2.4G<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-product-equipment-818274" >wireless <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> receiver module. On the left side, the spring-loaded battery compartment cover opens to reveal room for four AA batteries, beneath which is a guide diagram to assistance in orienting the batteries. On the opposite side, users will see a micro USB port (for firmware upgrades), and a flap that reveals an external power port and PC sync port underneath. On the bottom of the device, you’ll find a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/digital-cameras-and-photography-4781533" >hot shoe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> mount with a screw locking mechanism.</p><p> Finally, on the rear of the device users will see the LCD display and a suite of buttons and indicators, which we will cover in the next section.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Features-Functionality-Full-suite-manual-control"><a href="#Features-Functionality-Full-suite-manual-control" class="headerlink" title="Features &amp; Functionality: Full suite manual control"></a><strong>Features &amp; Functionality: Full suite manual control</strong></h2><p> The Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master has a lot of different options that will make it an attractive option for manual shooters. But before we dive into all the things it does well, let’s talk about what you_won’t_ find in this flash. The most notable omission is TTL. For the uninitiated, Through The Lens (TTL) is a metering mode that lets a flash unit fire a series of infrared bursts and evaluates the actual light coming through the lens to determine how much power to deliver when taking a photo. It’s very handy to have for beginners and event photographers, but by no means essential for many other types of users.</p><p> The other missing feature here is high-speed sync, which lets photographers shoot with shutter speeds in excess of 1&#x2F;250th of a second. High-speed sync is a newer feature, and useful in scenarios where you want to shoot at a high shutter speed and low aperture, like outdoor portraiture.</p><p> The YN560 IV has a lot of functionality, but it doesn’t have the most intuitive interface.</p><p> Neither of these features is particularly expected in a flash at this price point, but it’s worth mentioning in case you’re shopping for something that can cover that functionality.</p><p> Now, let’s talk about what the Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master is proficient at — manual, off-camera light. If you want to shoot mostly indoors, mostly in controlled settings, the YN560 IV is a pretty great pick.</p><p> Yongnuo provided this flash with 2.4GHz wireless triggering, as well as S1 and S2 optical trigger options. Those wishing to use this Speedlite solely with S1 or S2 optical trigger might be better served by a simpler, less expensive option. But if you plan on purchasing multiple units and using them together, the Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master is a great option. You can control the settings of all of the slave units remotely, which is a huge plus when dealing with more than two flashes. Not to mention the money you will save using multiple YN560 IVs instead of big brand competing products that often cost in excess of $200.</p><p> The Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master performed very well in our two and three light off-camera test setup, using an umbrella to take portraits.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-camera-flashes-to-buy-for-dslr-4072366" >Neewer TT560 Flash Speedlite Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Setup-A-lot-of-reading-before-use"><a href="#Setup-A-lot-of-reading-before-use" class="headerlink" title="Setup: A lot of reading before use"></a><strong>Setup: A lot of reading before use</strong></h2><p> Once you unpack your flash and install the four AA batteries, you’re going to want to familiarize yourself with the buttons and menu system a little. The YN560 IV has a lot of functionality, but it doesn’t have the most intuitive interface. The front of the device contains a top row of four buttons (a Light&#x2F;Music icon, Mode, a Wi-Fi icon, and Zoom). Below this is a charge indicator button marked “PILOT”, a direction pad, and an On&#x2F;Off button.</p><p> It’s not immediately evident what the four buttons in the top row do. For example, the Mode button, instead of changing the trigger mode as one might assume, instead changes between M and Multi — modes which themselves require further reading. M functions like a typical manual flash would, while Multi is a programmable strobe mode which lets you pick power, number of repetitions, and frequency of flashes.</p><p> If you plan on purchasing multiple units and using them together, the Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master is a great option.</p><p> The button with the Wi-Fi icon on it to the right of the Mode button is used to toggle between trigger modes. Here you may select the radio trigger modes TX and RX (for transmitter and receiver, respectively), and the standard S1 and S2 optical trigger modes. Yongnuo could have definitely done a better job explaining all of these things more clearly.</p><p> The last quirk that users will have to familiarize themselves with is that a lot of menu functionality is only accessed by pressing two of the top row buttons simultaneously. Pressing the first two opens the advanced options, pressing the middle two issues an activation command to the slave units when in TX mode, and pressing the final two buttons lets you set the channel.</p><p> Overall, the YN560 IV gives you a lot of functionality and control, but definitely requires some reading and troubleshooting before you can master the device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047351/19272" target="_top" id="2047351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Significant-savings-for-manual-users"><a href="#Price-Significant-savings-for-manual-users" class="headerlink" title="Price: Significant savings for manual users"></a><strong>Price: Significant savings for manual users</strong></h2><p> Buyers that need a lot of manual control for complex flash setups will be very pleased with what the get for the approximately $60 the YN560 IV costs. It sits at a price that’s a fraction of its TTL-enabled Canon and Nikon counterparts, but twice that of even simpler options. Do you need all the functionality that the YN560 IV offers? Are you willing to troubleshoot a bit with returns to make sure you get good, non-defective units? If the answer to those questions is yes, this is definitely the flash for you.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Yongnuo-YN560-IV-Wireless-Flash-Speedlite-Master-vs-Neewer-TT560-Flash-Speedlite"><a href="#Yongnuo-YN560-IV-Wireless-Flash-Speedlite-Master-vs-Neewer-TT560-Flash-Speedlite" class="headerlink" title="Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master vs Neewer TT560 Flash Speedlite"></a><strong>Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master vs Neewer TT560 Flash Speedlite</strong></h2><p> Photographers just starting out (or with significantly less complicated lighting ambitions) might be better served by getting a dead-simple option like the Neewer TT560 Flash Speedlite. It’s a no-fuss option with very few extraneous controls that will be a good starting point for most users, and solid for pros who don’t want more than optical trigger functionality on a flash.</p><p> If you feel like you’ve outgrown the capabilities of simpler flashes, however, or simply want more room for growth, the Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master offers a lot more for another $30.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/neewer-tt560-flash-speedlite-review-4686826" >Neewer TT560 Flash Speedlite Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Full featured manual flash</strong></p><p> The Yongnuo YN560 IV Wireless Flash Speedlite Master may not be a very simple flash, but it packs enough functionality to make a very versatile platform for more aspirational photographers. Buyers that want full manual control and radio transmission without paying an arm and a leg will be more than pleased with what they get.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none;

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR sound card was a great card in 2013. In 2019, however, the ZxR has started to lag behind the competition. It provides pretty clear audio, but it requires two PCIe slots and costs $250 MSRP. Compare this to products from other audio card manufacturers, such as ASUS and EVGA, which been able to provide better audio performance for as little as $160. That said, the Sound Blaster ZxR isn’t without merits: it has a lot of inputs and outputs, extensive EQ software, and still produces quality sound. It also has features gamers need, such as treble boost and voice isolation, and it accommodates 6.3mm auxiliary input and output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U_vmwZDe5HbbungQ5L2hzf2LVto=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-4-b0d1cca56ec04a61b83e20d1cecf2aea.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-convenient"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-convenient" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and convenient"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and convenient</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR features a black and red chassis on its main and daughter boards, brightly accented in gold around the transistors and back plate. Together, the cards have enough outputs to natively support a 5.1 surround sound speaker system. They have 2 RCA outputs, 2 3.5mm outputs, two RCA inputs, one optical TOSLINK input, one optical TOSLINK output, one 6.3mm microphone input, and one 6.3 headphone output jack. The ZxR also comes with an Audio Control Module (ACM), which is Creative Labs’ take on an amplifier and on extending the 6.3mm connections. It has both 3.5mm and 6.3mm inputs and outputs so you can choose where you’d like to plug in your headphones and microphone. On the ACM’s face lies a big, plastic volume knob that controls the headphones’ loudness.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Some-odd-decisions"><a href="#Hardware-Some-odd-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Hardware: Some odd decisions"></a><strong>Hardware: Some odd decisions</strong></h2><p> For users who may own higher impedance headphones, the amplifier can comfortably drive headphones with up to a 600 ohm impedance. Unfortunately, the volume control on the ACM works passively by altering the output impedance, which can distort audio on headphones with high inductance like the Sennheiser HD800 (see “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-output-impedance-4690092" >How Low Should Output Impedance Be? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ”). A better and only slightly more costly solution for Creative Labs would have been to have the knob control the ZxR’s in-built volume control rather than try to do it passively. The HD800 sounded fine when plugged directly into the sound card and using the system volume control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1t84P8oe4qch2aJ6lknx0lwunWw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-2-de43d07bd3db40a282f55347c8956c9a.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup"><a href="#Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup"></a><strong>Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup</strong></h2><p> To install the hardware, we popped open our mid-size PC tower and inserted the sound card and daughter board into two available PCIe slots. Creative Labs had the foresight to build the main card with a PCIe 1x slots, giving the user flexibility in where they connect their cards to the motherboard. Once the cards were secured, we plugged the headphones and microphone into the corresponding jacks.</p><p> It’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP.</p><p> Unfortunately, configuring Creative Labs’ drivers and software suite was a much less intuitive process. The ZxR’s outputs are controlled via the Sound Blaster Z-series Software, where users can select whether they’re listening with their headphones or their speakers, apply EQ effects, and more. By default, the software is set to output to speakers with several different EQ effects turned on. We had to manually switch it to headphone output and turn off EQ; the software does not automatically detect which jacks are in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6uorHzKoJdW1FBv0B5ZfeoE8XzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-3-17de2156e4294b5c85f151bd0cd97aa4.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148129/17093" target="_top" id="2148129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2148129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148129/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Audio-Excellent-sound"><a href="#Audio-Excellent-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Excellent sound"></a><strong>Audio: Excellent sound</strong></h2><p> Once the EQ effects are turned off, the Sound Blaster ZxR provides beautiful sound. While it wasn’t quite as clean or crisp as an enthusiast audiophile amplifier, such as the OPPO HA-1, it was solid for a system that costs a quarter of the HA-1’s price. On the HD-800s, the bass came across slightly muddy, but the ZxR provides solid quality for consumer-grade headphones like the Sennheiser GSP300 or the Sony MDR-7506. As our our<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/headphones-buying-guide-4172763" >headphone buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggests, most headphones under $250 will not be sensitive enough to meaningfully distinguish between the ZxR and the HA-1.</p><p> Should you happen to own dynamic headphones, you should find their impedance curve. Dynamic headphones with a high impedance may be distorted by the ACM, thanks to the ACM’s high resistance. How your headphones will be affected depends on their impedance curve: for the HD800s, for example, there is a peak at 100Hz (this range captures electric bass and the lower octaves of guitars), so the upper bass range is boosted relative to the other frequencies in the audio. Increasing the volume on the ACM reduces its output resistance and in turn reduces the distortion, but it may be easier to plug equipment directly into the sound card and use the system volume instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1CZw4BSxxTqlBF1kxT0_rl73XCU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-5-e1022e9adc854517af98407c4be32691.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052059/7443" target="_top" id="2052059">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052059" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052059/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972665/19272" target="_top" id="1972665">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972665" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972665/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options with mixed utility"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options with mixed utility</strong></h2><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package. Here, you can EQ any frequency between 20 and 20,000 Hz or activate “Crystallization,” “Scout Mode,” and “Theater Mode.” Crystallization adds punch to the audio’s treble, making voices stand out against the background. Theater Mode is similar to Crystallization, but it tries to_only_ boost voices instead of the entire treble range. We found it great for watching videos. Meanwhile, Scout Mode is squarely aimed at gamers. It theoretically makes enemy noises like footsteps louder.</p><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package.</p><p> When testing Scout Mode in_Overwatch_ , we did not find the adjustment helpful; Scout Mode made our enemies’ and our allies’ movements louder, making it harder to tell where the enemy was coming from. Without adjustments,<em>Overwatch’s</em> audio already makes the enemies’ movements louder than your allies’, making Scout Mode not only ineffective but an active detriment to gameplay. Other games that strongly rely on situational awareness have also likely invested the time into making enemies’ movements noticeable. Overall the software modifications Sound Blaster provides are situationally useful but not the comprehensive range of options we’d like to see at this price point.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Unjustified-expense"><a href="#Price-Unjustified-expense" class="headerlink" title="Price: Unjustified expense"></a><strong>Price: Unjustified expense</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR retails for about $250, on par with other high-end consumer audio cards. Its 6.3mm audio and microphone jacks, coupled with support for headphone impedance of up to 600 ohms, gives the listener flexibility in the rest of their audio setup: no need for 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapters or extension cords. One major hardware disappointment is its lack of 7.1 surround compatibility, which is something many sound card enthusiasts prize in a high-end sound card. There are also a number of other products with better sound quality for less than the ZxR’s $250 MSRP.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short of less expensive options"></a><strong>Competition:</strong> <strong>Falls short of less expensive options</strong></h2><p> As we’ve already emphasized, it’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP. You can find a number of sound cards for significantly less that provide competitive performance, though they generally don’t offer the same robust software package as the ZxR.</p><p> For a fraction of the price ($99 MSRP), you could get your hands on the Schitt Audio Fulla, an external DAC&#x2F;AMP set that covers 16 to 300 ohm headphones with plenty of power and has a clean, no-nonsense design. While it doesn’t offer the level of software support as the ZxR (those who want to dive deep into live microphone sound manipulation may not find what they need), for the consumer looking to delve into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hi-res-audio-4134630" >Hi-Fi audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this is an excellent deal.</p><p> At the $215 mark, still well below the price of the ZxR, the EVGA Nu audio card performs as well as external DAC&#x2F;AMPs in the $1,000 range. It also has minimalist software which Sound Blaster devotees may find a little feature-light, but even given the dearth of software options the EVGA Nu is the clear winner.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/evga-nu-audio-card-review-4769828" >EVGA Nu Audio Card Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> For about $160, the Asus Strix Raid PRO delivers better audio than the Sound Blaster ZxR and a control module that’s more useful than the ACM. The Strix’s “control box” has a button to turn EQ presets on and off, to change output between headphones and speakers, and all the features of the ACM (save 6.3mm jacks). The EQ button, which Asus calls the Raid button, is especially useful for gamers to switch between modes in-game.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-strix-raid-pro-review-4769832" >ASUS Strix Raid PRO Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good card that’s showing its age.</strong></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR is a quality, expensive sound card, with comprehensive software features and the hardware to power great consumer headsets and microphones. The ZxR sounds good, and gamers will not be disappointed by the ZxR’s power, but audio purists and 7.1 surround fans can find cleaner performance with fewer bells and whistles for the $250 asking price of the ZxR. It’s a card that hasn’t aged well since it’s 2013 release, and one that’s been largely overshadowed by some of its competitors in the interim.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches bring a bounty of functionality to the table—and right to your wrist. But these devices also tend to cast a wider net that includes fitness tracking among many other tools like listening to music or responding to email. If focusing on workouts and general wellness is your priority, you may be interested in scaling back from a full-blown<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a full-time fitness tracker like the Samsung Galaxy Fit.</p><p> This new addition to the Samsung wearable lineup carries over many of the hallmarks of smartwatches offered by the brand, but in a much slimmer profile and a more targeted and accurate focus on fitness.</p><p> We tested the Samsung Galaxy Fit on its ability to track workouts and how comfortable it is as a 24&#x2F;7 accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Tf5FJJb3h1iBWaZIkx-ZF7NeOTg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-6-b9990e3655e34e2ca712150225748ab6.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated"><a href="#Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated" class="headerlink" title="Design: Functional and slightly elevated"></a><strong>Design: Functional and slightly elevated</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit is a fitness-oriented device, and the design reflects this. It’s clean, minimal, and straightforward. Not only is this wearable extremely lightweight at only 0.81 ounces, but it’s also quite slim, which gives it a bracelet-like appearance.</p><p> There’s only one button to interact with, and it’s located on the left side of the watch and is responsive and straightforward to use. The strap is made of durable rubber and includes plenty of notches for a close fit. While the band is more focused on ruggedness and skews more toward the typical fitness watch aesthetic, the screen gives the device a more refined appearance.</p><p> The face is long and narrow and features a crisp, full-color AMOLED 120 x 240 display. This bright display is pleasing to the eye, but the scroll interaction is somewhat awkward given the size of the screen. A very light touch is necessary, and even then, it may take some time to get used to scrolling on such a narrow surface area.</p><p> We found the quick-access menu particularly difficult to maneuver. A swipe down from the top of the screen reveals it, but swiping to the right to toggle through all the options often just closed the menu altogether.</p><p> While this watch is diminutive in size, it can withstand the wear and tear that comes with biking, swimming, and other activities. The device as a whole is rugged and heavy-duty enough to withstand 50 meters of water as well as a drop or two, according to the MIL-STD-810G durability rating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uFwssrqnoTWtrPSlF6y16TFjA5A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-2-2e9d9cba7ec342918320509e630b0f09.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point"><a href="#Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Speedy and to the point"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Speedy and to the point</strong></h2><p> Other than the watch itself, the only other equipment is a wireless charging dock. Charging to 100 percent is recommended at setup, and it took us about 40 minutes for the device to charge in full from about 70 percent charged out of the box.</p><p> After that, we downloaded the compatible app for the device, called Galaxy Fit. We were able to pair the device in just a few seconds. We also had to download the Samsung Health app in order to access our activity data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E_Ki7o6LChwW9AdtjDKL2L1lHjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-4-abd906dedc9c440188c23a5aabdfebe0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115921/19272" target="_top" id="2115921">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115921" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115921/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Almost-undetectable"><a href="#Comfort-Almost-undetectable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Almost undetectable"></a><strong>Comfort: Almost undetectable</strong></h2><p> Like the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4174640" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , this device also features a tucked-in strap. The difference is that there’s a little pin with a round head instead of the straight pin that most watch buckles have. This detail makes for an extremely close fit that verges on almost too close.</p><p> The combination of such a close fit and little surface area made it a somewhat awkward to put on and take off the device—it was easier to ask for a second pair of hands to help nudge the strap out from underneath the band than wrestle with it alone.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, it was generally undetectable for most of the day, including while sleeping. When we did notice it, it was because it felt too snug, which was often the case by the end of day. Adjusting the fit for a looser feel left gapping in the band.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, its generally undetectable for most of the day—including while sleeping.</p><p> A little more surface area on the band and additional notches could be helpful for a more middle-of-the-line fit—what felt fine in the morning often felt way too tight by the end of the day.</p><p> So while it was mostly comfortable for general wear and during exercise activities, we found that the fit suffered from being either too tight or too loose because the adjustments weren’t incremental enough. It was hard to find a just-right middle ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRdpyMKwwNLE2m_Dnn2o9thnpQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-3-40a8d98ca4a04e7c9b5b18531df43e6f.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy"><a href="#Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Performance: High marks for accuracy"></a><strong>Performance: High marks for accuracy</strong></h2><p> Since fitness tracking is really the name of the game for this device, we had high hopes that it would perform well. We weren’t disappointed by what we found. We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> On a walk, steps logged were in line with a Garmin watch we use to track activity, and so was running. The running data was particularly impressive to see stacked up against the running-focused Garmin watch. Even without initiating a run workout, mileage, time elapsed, pace, and cadence were all within very close range. The Garmin edged out the Galaxy Fit with heart rate and cadence details throughout the run instead of just an overall summary. But all in all, the accuracy was really quite spot on.</p><p> We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> Samsung says that swimming is automatically detected by the watch and water lock mode will initiate on its own, and we found that to be spot on when we took this watch along for laps in the pool. The results compiled in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072" >Samsung Health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app after the workout were also surprisingly detailed. We were able to see the strokes we’d performed and our corresponding pace, our stroke rate, overall distance covered, and something called SWOLF, which is a way to measure stroke efficiency.</p><p> One downside we noticed is that the Fit did not capture mileage for cycling workouts. While it did accurately and automatically track the time elapsed, there was little detail beyond that. The only way to track miles, pace, and speed was to launch a cycling workout through the Samsung Health app.</p><p> All activity data, including information on sleep quality and patterns, is laid out clearly in the supplementary Samsung Health app, which is particularly useful for viewing a week’s worth of activity data. It’s really the only way to see beyond the most recent activity or two, which is all the watch will show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/APk5ikkGQieSTN39gBAQ6rf6H9E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-5-5ff5a7cfa0c34594b8d74bbb224e9800.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use"><a href="#Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Good for a full week of use"></a><strong>Battery: Good for a full week of use</strong></h2><p> Samsung says this watch is good for up to seven to eight days with regular activity and use, and up to eleven days with minimal use. We found that this watch lasted on the initial charge for a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitness-trackers-with-the-best-battery-life-4077272" >eight days <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lined up with the manufacturer claims. It’s hard to say how the battery life would stack up to multiple workouts in a day—we typically only did one a day over the course of a week, but our experience with the device supports the strong battery life claims.</p><p> When we did have to charge the device again, we found that process to be speedy: it took only two hours to recharge in full.</p><h2 id="Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app"><a href="#Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app"></a><strong>Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app</strong></h2><p> Unlike other Samsung smartwatches, the Samsung Galaxy Fit is built on a FreeRTOS (real time operation software) platform. This OS relies heavily on the companion smartphone app and the Samsung Health app for a well-rounded experience.</p><p> Most of the settings for notifications and even choosing quick, pre-written responses to texts can be set up through the mobile app. You can also choose watch faces to personalize the style of your Galaxy Fit—there’s a specific screen inside the app that details all the design options and allows you to change the look whenever you want.</p><p> In addition to controlling the watch settings easily from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Samsung Health app is the other go-to resource. Here you can view all the information captured by the activity tracker, including fitness, sleep, and even stress levels. You can also take this a step further by using the app to monitor calories, weight, and water intake.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105863/7443" target="_top" id="2105863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105863/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Great-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Great-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Great for what you get</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit retails for $99.99, which makes it a strong competitor in the fitness tracker market. Similarly-priced devices from the Fitbit brand offer an equivalent bundle of all-day activity tracking and general wellness features but lack the vibrant display of the Galaxy Fit.</p><p> There are cheaper options out there, too, like the Garmin vívofit 4, which sells for between $60 and $80. But it lacks a heart rate monitor or the smart capabilities of the Fit, like canned text-messaging responses and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail. For the activity tracking and smart device functionality, the Fit is a fair price and maybe even a bargain for some.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014853/22899" target="_top" id="2014853">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014853" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014853/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR"></a><strong>Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR is a close competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Fit. Both are priced at just below $100 and have many of the same wellness and activity tracking features. Both are water resistant up to 50 meters, track active and resting heart rate, feature sport profiles, log sleeping activity, and integrate various types of notifications.</p><p> But the Galaxy Fit offers wireless charging and a full-color display, while the Fitbit Inspire HR comes with a charging cable and sports a grayscale<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display. The Fitbit also only has a five-day battery life versus the maximum eleven-day battery life on the Fit. But the FitBit Inspire HR also comes with some tools that the Fit lacks, like a timer and stopwatch and menstrual tracking.</p><p> Not quite sure if a fitness tracker or smartwatch is for you?

Keep reading for their full product review.</em></p><p> If you use your laptop for playing games or running high-performance apps, then you’ve probably seen it get very warm and kick on its potentially loud internal fans. However, the built-in fans can only do so much to dissipate the immense heat built within, try as they might. That’s where laptop cooling pads come in, blasting additional cool air into your laptop to help take down the internal and external temperatures.</p><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops.</p><p> Kootek’s Laptop Cooling Pad isn’t the cheapest option around, nor is it the most premium—but it’s effective and sells for a reasonable price, and is large enough to accommodate larger laptops with 17-inch displays. A clunky height adjustment system is the main drawback, but it doesn’t stop the Kootek pad from working as expected.</p><h2 id="Design-Clunky-but-it-works"><a href="#Design-Clunky-but-it-works" class="headerlink" title="Design: Clunky, but it works"></a>Design: Clunky, but it works</h2><p> The Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a larger unit, measuring nearly 15 inches wide, 11.8 inches tall, and about 1.4 inches thick, with a weight of 2.6 pounds. It’s heavier and bulkier than the lightweight TopMate C302 Cooling Pad, for example, and feels more durable as a result.</p><p> It’s built for laptops with screens between 12 and 17 inches diagonal, with a wide metal grate on the surface to help dissipate heat as the five fans blow onto your laptop. Most of the rest of the build is plastic. Each fan has red LED lighting for an added glow to the pad.</p><p> The height adjustment system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution.</p><p> Two flip-up, padded stoppers at the bottom of the surface help keep your laptop in place even when you have the pad angled, thanks to the height adjustment system. Granted, that system is easily my least favorite part of this cooling pad.</p><p> Essentially, there’s a loose metal bar hanging from the main unit of the cooling pad, and you’ll slot that into one of six ridges on the bottom stand to prop it up. The system doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as having flip-out legs, and it’s loud and awkward in execution. It works and it provides finer-grain height adjustment levels, but it feels like a clunky solution for a tech accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Uuby879oWyaUH6_3WN7ZssAF-g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_04-73dc23f85de34fa087b21b21461f9f74.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> There are two buttons at the back of the pad: One button controls the large, central fan (4.72 inches), while the other controls the four smaller fans (2.76 inches each). I’m not sure why you would choose to use only some fans at any given time, since they’re all quiet, but the option is there if you want it.

It’s a solidly powerful gaming laptop, and I put it to the test with a couple of popular games as well as a graphics benchmark test.</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid impact in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite.</p><p> I recorded the internal temperature using NZXT’s CAM app and the external temperature with a infrared thermometer, first with the laptop by itself. After it cooled down, I tested again with the cooling pad equipped the whole time.</p><p> In racing game Dirt 5’s built-in benchmark test, the Razer Blade put up an internal processor temperature of 184 degrees Fahrenheit and external temperature of 117 degrees, but peaked at 169 degrees internal and 107 degrees external with the Kootek pad equipped. The average frame rate was nearly identical between tests, with no significant difference from the use of the cooling pad.</p><p> Meanwhile, I saw a peak internal temperature of 196 degrees when playing Fortnite, along with an external temperature of 118 degrees. With the cooling pad equipped, I saw a slightly lower internal peak of 192 degrees, although it mostly hovered in the 160 to 170-degree range during testing. The external peak with the Kootek pad was 106 degrees. Curiously, I saw the exact same numbers with the Heaven graphics benchmark test with and without the cooling pad: 162 degrees internally and 109 degrees external.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ppFnQ9kEpjbEV9cYbHzLRI5j-j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_05-4a4d5ee065a94c3e984ae0c96f4916d8.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> All told, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad made a solid effort in lowering the temperature of the Razer Blade 15 while playing Dirt 5 and Fortnite, although the cheaper, dual-fan TopMate C302 cooling pad saw slightly better overall results. Your experience may vary depending on your laptop of choice, however. All the while, the Kootek pad stayed pretty quiet in stark contrast to the Razer Blade’s own very loud internal fans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Entirely-reasonable"><a href="#Price-Entirely-reasonable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Entirely reasonable"></a>Price: Entirely reasonable</h2><p> At $26 from Amazon, the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad is a reasonably-priced option with solid performance and the ability to accommodate larger laptops. There are cheaper options out there, as well as some with additional features such as temperature sensors and additional fan controls, but Kootek’s device delivers good functionality for the price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/30UKekQcQjJ1mpixthV5avHNZsE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kootek_Laptop_Cooling_Pad_02-9e1418002e754b2c8e01cb12f766975a.jpg"                      alt="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043639/7443" target="_top" id="2043639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043639/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302"><a href="#Kootek-Laptop-Cooling-Pad-vs-TopMate-C302" class="headerlink" title="Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302"></a>Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad vs. TopMate C302</h2><p> As mentioned above, the TopMate C302 is a lighter, simpler cooling pad option. It’s designed for laptops up to 15 inches in size and isn’t quite as thick or heavy, but it gets the job done with effective cooling and straightforward design. Kootek’s pad offers an additional USB port for accessories, though, and allows for more height variance than the TopMate’s basic pop-out feet.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good all-around option.</strong></p><p> A clunky design makes the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad a bit awkward in use, but ultimately it does a solid job of cooling hot laptops and accommodating larger-sized devices. The extra USB ports are handy, especially for port-limited laptops, and the price is reasonable.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/flexispot-theodore-standing-desk-review-5183806" >Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/procase-macbook-pro-13-case-review-4689945" >ProCase MacBook Pro 13 Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/north-face-pivoter-backpack-review-4690198" >North Face Pivoter Backpack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Laptop Cooling Pad</li><li>Product Brand  Kootek</li><li>MPN  LCP05</li><li>Price  $35.99</li><li>Release Date  August 2018</li><li>Weight  2.91 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 11.8 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Blue, Red</li><li>Ports  USB-A x2</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-navigating-numbers-a-comprehensive-triad-strategy-for-monitoring-your-youtube-profitability/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Navigating Numbers A Comprehensive Triad Strategy for Monitoring Your YouTube Profitability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-pixizs-tools-for-photo-video-craftsmanship/"><u>[Updated] Navigating Pixiz's Tools for Photo-Video Craftsmanship</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/2024s-most-popular-and-highly-rated-karaoke-setups/"><u>2024'S Most Popular and Highly Rated Karaoke Setups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/achieving-perfect-network-coverage-with-the-netgeer-nightehawk-x4-an-insightful-extender-review/"><u>Achieving Perfect Network Coverage with the Netgeer Nightehawk X4 -

While I’ve built up great cities on earth, there is one place I haven’t been to: outer space. Surviving Mars fills this planet-sized hole.</p><p> Released in 2018, the Surviving Mars developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive poses a massive challenge: colonizing a planet. When I picked this up, I decided to check out how the game fared for a two-year-old game in terms of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/graphic-design-basics-s2-1074288" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , gameplay, and competition. Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying"><a href="#Performance-Humans-have-never-been-so-annoying" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Humans have never been so annoying"></a><strong>Performance: Humans have never been so annoying</strong></h2><p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135397/19272" target="_top" id="2135397">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135397" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135397/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130530/26400" target="_top" id="2130530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130530/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms.

To help you find the best option for your setup, we’ve researched and tested systems from all the top manufacturers, including Intel, Apple, Asus, and others.</p><p> Our Top Picks</p><p> Best Apple:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >Apple M2 Mac Mini at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-apple-apple-m2-mac-mini" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best Mountable:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro at Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-mountable-dell-optiplex-3070-micro" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best for Gaming:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >Origin PC Chronos at Originpc.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-for-gaming-origin-pc-chronos" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Best Pocket Performance:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 at Amazon  $330 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#toc-best-pocket-performance-intel-compute-stick-cs125" >Jump to Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Apple"><a href="#Best-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Best Apple"></a>Best Apple</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >Apple M2 Mac Mini <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pd8O04wozNFrXoZkq9mLvPa70OA=/fit-in/1500x1102/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Apple-Mac-mini-M2-and-M2-Pro-hero-230117-a58d050768ff412bbd48a60747d03a62.jpg" >Mac Mini M2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Apple</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/" >View on Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746353-REG/apple%5Fmmfj3ll%5Fa%5Fmac%5Fmini%5Fwith%5Fm2.html" >View on B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.adorama.com/acmmfj3lla.html" >$599 at Adorama.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Compact form factor</li><li>Lots of configuration options</li><li>Runs up to two 4K displays</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>High base cost</li><li>Upgrades are expensive</li><li>Integrated graphics</li></ul><p> The M2 Mac Mini is a beautiful piece of tech with impressive specifications and a high price tag. Available in various configurations, the Mac Mini comes with one HDMI 2.0 port capable of piping 4K video to your TV, and you can also hook up a second 4K display via one of the included Thunderbolt 4 ports. All models include<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for connecting to your home network, and you can even upgrade to 10GB Ethernet and a compatible high-speed network-attached storage (NAS) unit to round out your home theater experience if you like.</p><p> The best thing about the M2 Mac Mini, which makes it so well suited to the role of home theater PC, is the diminutive, unassuming case. This tiny computer is small enough to slide into just about any home theater setup, either alongside or on top of your other components, and the sleek, silver case is unlikely to clash with the rest of your gear.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925468/19272" target="_top" id="1925468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925468/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Mountable"><a href="#Best-Mountable" class="headerlink" title="Best Mountable"></a>Best Mountable</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5Fu8oX3NbKI7TTjmNNZbexFRbMs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dell-optiplex-3070-desktop-computer---intel-core-i5-9500t---8gb-ram---256gb-ssd---micro-pc-4b06a3eade744016965e6f8bd76ee825.jpg" >Dell OptiPlex 3070 Desktop Computer - Intel Core i5-9500T - 8GB RAM - 256GB SSD - Micro PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&amp;publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Foptiplex-7010-small-ff%2Fs012dosffusvp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/optiplex-7010-small-ff/s012dosffusvp" >View on Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of mounting options</li><li>Entry unit very affordable</li><li>High performance options</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Mounting brackets cost extra</li><li>Only two high definition video outputs</li><li>No discrete graphics options</li></ul><p> The Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro is an excellent choice if you’re working on a budget and have space constraints. While this unit is small enough to fit into most home theater cabinets and other situations, you can mount it to the back of your VESA-compatible television with an optional bracket. Carefully route short cables behind your television and add a soundbar, and the Dell Optiplex 3070 can form the core of one of the stealthiest<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/separate-components-theater-system-setup-1846358" >home theater systems <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The entry-level Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro offers an excellent mix of affordability and performance, with a dual-core Pentium processor, 4GB DDR4 RAM, and a spacious 500 GB hard disk drive, all with a price tag lower than much of the competition. If you need a higher performance option, you can upgrade to a variety of Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors, add a 256GB PCIe SSD, add up to 8GB of RAM, and more.</p><p> The only real drawback of the Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro is that there isn’t any option for discrete graphics. If that isn’t important, then this line has much to offer.</p><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >Origin PC Chronos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6QzWM_zWynxfnbYZHsOGPauMkVQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/origin-pc-chronos-8f6801fc035949cda1674983b86c32e2.jpg" >Origin PC Chronos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Origin PC</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.originpc.com/gaming/desktops/chronos/" >View on Originpc.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Home theater and gaming in one package</li><li>Fantastic performance for the size</li><li>Some upgrades available</li><li>Compact design</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>No free PCIe slots for upgrades</li><li>No free DIMM slots for more RAM</li><li>Manufacturer add-ons are expensive</li></ul><p> The Origin Chronos is on the larger side of PCs we recommend for home theater settings, but there’s a good reason for the exception. This PC is still significantly smaller than your typical tower unit. Yet, it’s powerful enough to run the 4K display in your home theater system and then seamlessly switch over to play many of the latest games at the highest settings. If you’re a home-theater buff who is also into PC gaming, the Origin Chronos ticks all the right boxes.</p><p> While the Chronos is a bit on the large side, gamers will be immediately comfortable with the size and form factor. It doesn’t conform precisely to the size specifications of any specific game system. Still, it doesn’t look out of place next to an Xbox One or PlayStation 4, nor will it have overstayed its welcome by the time you upgrade to the next generation of consoles.</p><p> The base configuration of the Origin Chronos comes packed with a six-core AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super, which means you can even use it with some of the best VR headsets. You can also upgrade to various more powerful<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >Intel and AMD Ryzen CPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and even slot in a beastly Nvidia GeForce3 RTX Titan if you’re looking to future-proof your home theater and gaming experiences.</p><p> The Origin Chronos is a bit pricey if you’re not looking for a home theater PC that can double as a powerful gaming rig, but it’s a fantastic option if that is what you’re looking for. It even allows you to upgrade after the fact, like a traditional PC. However, the PCIe and DIMM slots are all full from the factory, so you’ll be replacing components with upgrades rather than just adding new functionality on top.</p><h2 id="Best-Pocket-Performance"><a href="#Best-Pocket-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Best Pocket Performance"></a>Best Pocket Performance</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IWj-nLakAVXRcFFnwLZ_74Scfkc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/intel-compute-stick-cs125-computer-with-intel-atom-x5-processor-and-windows-10-boxstk1aw32scblack-3692e45b206b45e08473c04bcb5814d8.jpg" >Intel Compute Stick CS125 Computer with Intel Atom x5 Processor and Windows 10 (BOXSTK1AW32SC),Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AZC4NHS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=1130838%7Cn4609df6833f5424ab389b2a91b8d428604%7CB01AZC4NHS" >$330 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Remarkably small size</li><li>Decent performance</li><li>Affordable</li><li>Full Windows experience</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Limited memory</li><li>Some versions are expensive</li><li>No upgradeability</li><li>Some models are sluggish</li></ul><p> The Intel Compute Stick is a tiny home theater PC with a form factor that isn’t much larger than most television streaming devices. It’s designed to plug directly into one of the HDMI ports on your television, or you can use an HDMI adapter if the Compute Stick is too big.</p><p> Unlike streaming devices with a similar form factor, the Intel Compute Stick is a legitimate Windows PC. It features the whole Windows 10 experience, which means you can use this tiny home theater PC to do anything you can with any other Windows computer. You can install apps, browse the internet, and stream media for your home theater.</p><p> The Intel Compute Stick comes in a few configurations, so choosing the right one is essential. The most affordable option packs a lightweight Atom processor suitable for basic streaming, but don’t expect it to do any heavy lifting. More expensive versions are available with faster processors, all in the same tiny form factor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-devices-to-buy-for-streaming-tv-4061016" >Streaming Devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Home-Theater-PC"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Home-Theater-PC" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Home Theater PC"></a>What to Look For in a Home Theater PC</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Processor"><a href="#Processor" class="headerlink" title="Processor"></a>Processor</h3><p> You’ll find home theater PCs equipped with both Intel and AMD CPUs. AMD is a fine choice if you’re after a budget model and don’t need high performance, while Intel typically provides higher performance. The latest AMD processors have flipped that script with a fantastic performance from their most expensive offerings, but you’re unlikely to make that kind of investment in a home theater PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014851/22899" target="_top" id="2014851">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014851" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014851/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Graphics-Card"><a href="#Graphics-Card" class="headerlink" title="Graphics Card"></a>Graphics Card</h3><p> You need your home theater PC to have a discrete graphics card for the best performance. It doesn’t need to be powerful enough to play the latest games if you aren’t also a gamer, but it does need to be powerful enough to drive an HD or 4K display or multiple displays, depending on your configuration. If budget is more important, you may have to settle for integrated graphics.</p><h3 id="Storage"><a href="#Storage" class="headerlink" title="Storage"></a>Storage</h3><p> You’ll need plenty of storage to convert your media library to digital content that you can play on your home theater PC or stream to other devices.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The TP-Link Archer A6 is a dual-band gigabit router that’s designed to provide some nice upgrades and features at a budget-friendly price. It includes features like dual 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO beamforming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , marking it out as a great upgrade for anyone using a budget router that’s more than a few years old. It does lack some features you can get out of a slightly higher priced budget unit, but the overall balance of feature set to price is attractive.</p><p> Specifications don’t always tell the whole story, so I recently spent about five days with a TP-Link Archer A6 plugged into my own network. I tested how well it holds up under daily use with a lot of data-hungry devices connected at once, tested top speeds and range on both bands, and more.</p><h2 id="Design-Improved-over-older-designs"><a href="#Design-Improved-over-older-designs" class="headerlink" title="Design: Improved over older designs"></a><strong>Design: Improved over older designs</strong></h2><p> The Archer A6 doesn’t exactly stand out of the crowd, but it’s a definite improvement over the older C7 that I keep around for testing purposes. Instead of the flat or glossy black finish seen on most routers, the A6 has a two-tone crosshatched pattern that creates an interesting visual effect. The edges are rounded instead of angular, and the top actually curves gently downward when viewed head-on.</p><p> The A6 features four antennas, two on the back, and the other two on the sides. They rotate easily for better positioning, but they aren’t removable. That’s a bit of a knock on this unit, as the ability to remove and replace antennas is pretty standard even in budget devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eeaRHW4APuNCYThw1t-TVwYpmSI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_WirelessRouters_ArcherA6AC1200_04-4739ffd6705348959e05e41ab9da2292.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer A6 AC1200"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> The ports and power button are all found on the back of the unit in a fairly standard array, and you’ll find the indicator LEDs on top near the front edge. The positioning is good for desktop use, and it also leaves the indicators clearly visible when wall mounted.</p><p> The Archer A6 doesn’t exactly stand out of the crowd, but it’s a definite improvement over the older C7 that I keep around for testing purposes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975555">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975555">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975555%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975555/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Completely-painless-once-you-unwrap-the-antennas"><a href="#Setup-Process-Completely-painless-once-you-unwrap-the-antennas" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Completely painless once you unwrap the antennas"></a><strong>Setup Process: Completely painless once you unwrap the antennas</strong></h2><p> This router comes fully assembled, which makes it a bit easier and faster to set up than most. I’m not a fan of the fact that you can’t remove the antennas, but it definitely saves a bit of time. Unfortunately, that saved time is mostly wiped out by the ridiculous wrap job TP-Link does on the side antennas.</p><p> The rear antennas are loosely wrapped in a sticky film that you’re probably familiar with if you’ve ever unboxed a router, but the side antennas are shrink-wrapped in a resilient material that I was unable to remove by hand. I eventually resorted to a razor blade to carefully slice the antennas free without damaging them.</p><p> This router comes fully assembled, which makes it a bit easier and faster to set up than most.</p><p> Once you finish unwrapping the antennas, setting up the Archer A6 is a breeze. I didn’t even have to reboot my modem when I swapped the A6 for the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/eero-pro-mesh-wi-fi-system-review-4797008" >Eero router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I normally use. Getting the router up and running was literally a matter of plugging in the Ethernet cables, powering it up, and logging into the web interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2zSHbpT2Rq4Ac-0-u73213g1rlk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_WirelessRouters_ArcherA6AC1200_02-8fd53e1cd8284fd4a40091d7896fe8db.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer A6 AC1200"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037318/7443" target="_top" id="2037318">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037318" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037318/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Dual-band-with-MU-MIMO-but-lacking-in-physical-ports"><a href="#Connectivity-Dual-band-with-MU-MIMO-but-lacking-in-physical-ports" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Dual-band with MU-MIMO, but lacking in physical ports"></a><strong>Connectivity: Dual-band with MU-MIMO, but lacking in physical ports</strong></h2><p> The TP-Link Archer A6 is an AC1200<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that supports MU-MIMO beamforming. The total throughput is a little on the light side if you have a lot of devices, but MU-MIMO is a nice feature to see in such an affordable unit.</p><p> On the physical side, the A6 comes with a bare minimum single WAN port and four LAN ports. There isn’t even a single USB port, so you can’t use this router to host a networked USB drive. That isn’t completely unexpected from a budget router, but it would have been nice if it included at least one USB port.</p><p> On the physical side, the A6 comes with a bare minimum single WAN port and four LAN ports.

That’s more or less in line with other routers I tested at the same time, although my Eero did notch a maximum download speed of 627Mbps during that same round of testing.</p><p> Next up, I connected to the 5GHz wireless network a few feet from the router. Using the<a class="link"   href="https://www.speedtest.net/" >Ookla speed test <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, I measured the top download speed of 249Mbps and an upload speed of 64Mbps. That’s plenty fast for gaming, streaming 4K video, and just about everything else, but it’s much slower than I’ve seen out of higher-end routers on the same connection.</p><p> The next test was performed about 15 feet from the router with a closed-door blocking the signal. At that range, the Archer A6 actually stepped up its performance a little, possibly due to my test device seeing less interference in the hallway than in my office. I saw a maximum download speed of 365Mpbs and an upload of 64Mbps at that distance.</p><p> I performed the next test about 50 feet away, with several walls, furniture, and appliances blocking the signal. At that range, the download speed dropped to 195 Mbps. That’s still a pretty good performance, although the much more expensive ASUS ROG Rapture I tested at the same time held tight with download speeds of 395Mbps at the same distance.</p><p> For my final test, I headed down to my garage, putting about a hundred feet and a significant amount of obstructions in the way. My mobile device was only able to connect to the 2.4Ghz network at that range, and it notched a download speed of 13.4Mbps. That’s workable, but it’s also a sign that you may end up needing a Wi-Fi range extender with the Archer A6 even if your house isn’t that large.</p><p> You may end up needing a Wi-Fi range extender with the Archer A6 even if your house isn’t that large.</p><h2 id="Software-Basic-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Basic-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Basic and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Basic and easy to use</strong></h2><p> The Archer A6 uses the same familiar web interface TP-Link has used for years. If you’ve ever used a TP-Link router before, you’ll already be familiar with the system. If you haven’t, it’s very easy to pick up.</p><p> The interface is laid out in two tabs, basic and advanced, with an optional quick setup. Click the quick setup, and it will run you through all the basics to get the router up and running, set up both wireless networks and basic settings that work well enough for most people.</p><p> The basic tab provides you with the most important information, like the status of your internet connection and Wi-Fi networks, and how many devices are currently connected. You can easily access internet settings, wireless settings, parental controls, and fire up the guest network if you need it.</p><p> The advanced tab digs down into settings like parental controls, where you can set profiles to block access to certain content and create time limits, the firewall, and NAT forwarding.</p><p> In addition to the web interface, TP-Link also offers a phone app that lets you change basic settings. Advanced settings have to be accessed through the web portal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/2qgk2j764OivVDjAgICPpQb-Xig=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_WirelessRouters_ArcherA6AC1200_03-7abb56dd933947dc892f8ec43ef36863.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer A6 AC1200"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130532/26400" target="_top" id="2130532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130532/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Good-price-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Good-price-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good price for the features"></a><strong>Price: Good price for the features</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $50, the Archer A6 represents pretty decent value for the level of performance and the feature set it offers. You may want to step up to a more expensive unit if you have a big house or a lot of devices, and it is missing features like a USB port, but the Archer A6 is priced very well for what you get.</p><h2 id="TP-Link-Archer-A6-vs-TP-Link-Archer-A7"><a href="#TP-Link-Archer-A6-vs-TP-Link-Archer-A7" class="headerlink" title="TP-Link Archer A6 vs. TP-Link Archer A7"></a><strong>TP-Link Archer A6 vs. TP-Link Archer A7</strong></h2><p> Don’t let the numbering scheme confuse you. The Archer A7 (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AC1750-Smart-WiFi-Router/dp/B079JD7F7G%2520/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846342%7Cndd707df741a44bb699bcdb4f97d36f3622%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is actually an older device than the A6. It’s also a little more expensive, with an MSRP of $80 and a little faster, with an AC1750 rating compared to the AC1200 of the Archer A6.</p><p> The most important difference between these two routers is that the Archer A6 uses a newer chipset that allows it to offer MU-MIMO beamforming. The A6 also features four antennas compared to just three from the A7. So while the Archer A7 is rated at slightly higher speeds, the A6 actually performs better in the real world while still coming in at a lower price.</p><p> The Archer A7 is an example of a slightly more expensive router that provides the option to connect a USB drive, but the A6 still comes out on top due to the lower price point and more advanced chipset.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A great budget router that provides premium features.</strong></p><p> The TP-Link Archer A6 is a great little budget-priced router that performs better than I expected it to. It’s important to stress that it’s an AC1200 router, and it’s only dual-band, so don’t expect it to do the job if you have dozens of data-hungry devices or an especially large house with a complicated internal setup. But if you just want an affordable router that performs well across about 1,400-1,600 square feet of space, this is a great option.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Archer A6 AC1200 Gigabit Smart Wi-Fi Router</li><li>Product Brand  TP-Link</li><li>SKU  AC1200</li><li>Price  $49.99</li><li>Weight  1.76 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  9.1 x 5.7 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Speed  5GHz: Up to 867Mbps &amp; 2.4GHz: Up to 300Mbps</li><li>Warranty  Two years</li><li>Compatbility  Windows 10&#x2F;8.1&#x2F;8&#x2F;7&#x2F;Vista&#x2F;XP&#x2F;2000&#x2F;NT&#x2F;98SE, MacOS, Netware, Unix or Linux</li><li>Firewall  Yes</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antennas  4</li><li>Number of Bands  Dual-band</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  4x ethernet ports, 1x WAN port</li><li>Chipset  Qualcomm QCA9886</li><li>Range  Medium homes</li><li>Parental Controls  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/new-craftsmanship-in-photos-and-videos-the-ultimate-8-mobile-enhancement-tools/"><u>[New] Craftsmanship in Photos & Videos The Ultimate 8 Mobile Enhancement Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-photography-and-videography-leading-tech-on-the-market/"><u>[New] Photography & Videography Leading Tech on the Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-crafting-an-uninterrupted-viewing-experience-set-up-youtube-autoplay-on-fb/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crafting an Uninterrupted Viewing Experience Set Up Youtube Autoplay on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-instant-screener-chromeos-edition-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Instant Screener ChromeOS Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-screen-record-on-hp-laptop/"><u>2024 Approved How to Screen Record on Hp Laptop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/explore-the-depths-of-video-clarity-comprehensive-guide-to-vce-22-for-2024/"><u>Explore the Depths of Video Clarity - Comprehensive Guide to VCE 2.2 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/high-end-softbox-lighting-systems-reviewed-2024/"><u>High-End Softbox Lighting Systems Reviewed 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/how-the-value-packed-fitbit-versa-stacks-up-an-in-depth-review-for-savvy-shoppers/"><u>How the Value-Packed Fitbit Versa Stacks Up: An In-Depth Review for Savvy Shoppers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/hunt-for-amazing-prime-day-bargains-score-apple-deals/"><u>Hunt for Amazing Prime Day Bargains – Score Apple Deals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-kootek-laptop-chiller-analysis-the-ultimate-heat-dispeller/"><u>In-Depth Kootek Laptop Chiller Analysis: The Ultimate Heat Dispeller</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-lenovo-ideapad-robust-design-meets-simple-performance/"><u>In-Depth Look at the Lenovo Ideapad: Robust Design Meets Simple Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/inside-the-engine-room-the-apple-m1-unveiled-for-2024/"><u>Inside the Engine Room The Apple M1 Unveiled for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/insightful-review-on-google-wifi-a-versatile-and-user-friendly-mesh-wi-fi-network-solution/"><u>Insightful Review on Google Wifi: A Versatile and User-Friendly Mesh Wi-Fi Network Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/is-chromecast-with-google-tv-up-for-par-with-firetv-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Is Chromecast with Google TV Up for Par with FireTV?

Read on to see our results.</em></p><p> The Mac mini (M1, 2020) is the first Mac desktop to receive Apple’s new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/why-apple-designed-the-m1-chip-5087225" >ARM-based M1 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s also the most affordable way to dip your toe into the brave new world of Apple Silicon, even though it’s powered by the exact same chip found in the much more expensive MacBook Pro. It can’t<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/using-boot-camp-assistant-install-windows-2260115" >run Windows apps via Bootcamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like an Intel Mac, and there will be some growing pains as developers switch gears and start catering to the new hardware, but that hardware offers tremendous raw performance, excellent potential in the long term, and more than acceptable real-world performance in the short term.</p><p> While I was a bit skeptical of Apple’s decision to leave Intel behind, the promised performance of their custom silicon left me eager to dig in and see how that raw power really translates into real-world situations. I was able to spend about a week with an M1 Mac mini as my main work machine, plugging in my keyboard and monitors, with my primary rig left to gather dust for the duration.</p><p> During my time with the M1 Mac mini, I paid close attention to performance, of course, with a special eye to how well it handles non-native apps and apps that were designed for iOS. The lack of support for Bootcamp meant I wasn’t able to completely leave my old hardware behind, but there’s no getting around it: this is some impressive hardware at any price, let alone a price tag that’s cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aEGPK4B55KCbhrof83878utZpZQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-2-16eb4e84f8694bb6a76cf078906add40.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis"><a href="#Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis" class="headerlink" title="Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis"></a>Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis</h2><p> The big changes here are all under the hood, as Apple opted to leave the overall design of the Mac mini (M1, 2020) unchanged from the previous model. It’s still a block of milled aluminum with the same rounded corners, satin finish, and shiny Apple logo emblazoned on the top. The top is smooth and unmarked aside from the logo, and the front and sides of the case are completely featureless aside from a small LED on the front that lets you know when the system is powered on.</p><p> The ports are all found around the back, where the aluminum case is cut away to accommodate a black plastic panel. There you’ll find a power button and socket for the power cable, an Ethernet port, two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt 3 ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an HDMI port, two USB type A ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Situated just below this array of inputs is a cutout that reveals the internal heatsink.</p><p> The biggest change here from the last iteration of the hardware is that the last Mac mini featured four Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of just two. The configuration of the ports is even the same, drawing attention to the fact that just two ports occupy space that could easily support twice that number.</p><p> The bottom of the M1 Mac mini also remains unchanged from the last version of the hardware, with most of it taken up by a circular plastic cover that’s designed to allow easier access to the internals. As before, it causes the Mac mini to stand up a bit from whatever surface you place it on, and it has very little gripping power. If you place it on a slick surface, be aware that it could slide off with the slightest nudge.</p><p> Unlike the previous model, the M1 Mac mini doesn’t have any user serviceable parts or components. That means you’re stuck with the memory and storage configurations you choose at check out, and you can’t go back in later to add extra RAM or a bigger SSD.</p><p> The biggest disappointment here, aside from the fact that the M1 Mac mini didn’t receive any sort of aesthetic update, is that Apple removed two Thunderbolt ports and the ability to upgrade your memory. The first isn’t that big of an issue, since the Mac mini looked great before and still looks great. The lack of Thunderbolt ports, similarly, isn’t a huge deal, because there are a ton of ways to get around such a limitation. The lack of upgradeability certainly removes a degree of flexibility from the hardware, though, making it much more important to select the amount of memory and storage that you’ll be comfortable with for the life of the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xpt3pmIvU6FTBUo0tBDpyp3BERE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-3-844f657110aa424db6f1e5bac1b19eda.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse"></a>Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse</h2><p> If you’ve ever set up a macOS device before, the setup process isn’t any different here. It’s just a matter of accepting some terms, tweaking some initial settings, and connecting your Apple ID. As always, setup is going to be easier if you have access to another functional piece of Apple hardware that you’re already logged into.</p><p> The one wrinkle that you may run into is that you can’t set up the Mac mini with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. You’ll need to plug a wired keyboard and mouse in to complete the setup process and then pair your Bluetooth hardware, or use a keyboard and mouse combo that uses a wireless dongle.</p><p> For example, I was able to plug in the dongle from my Logitech K400+ Touch Keyboard, and the Mac mini recognized the peripheral immediately. That allowed me to complete the setup process without digging around for wired peripherals.</p><h2 id="Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups"><a href="#Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups"></a>Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups</h2><p> While the Mac mini (M1, 2020) remained mostly unchanged from a design perspective, the internals received a massive overhaul. This is Apple’s first desktop to receive its new M1 chip, and that’s a really big deal. Though one of the M1’s headline features, reduced power use, isn’t as big a deal here as it is in the MacBook Air, this chip is still massively more powerful than anything you’ve ever seen in a Mac before. In fact, the Mac mini has the exact same chip as the MacBook Pro, with one more GPU core than the MacBook Air.</p><p> The M1 CPU features eight cores, including four performance cores and four efficiency cores, and the same chip also includes an eight core GPU.</p><p> This isn’t an Intel integrated graphics situation, though. The M1 boasts some pretty impressive processing power from both the CPU and GPU components. In real world terms, that translates to silky-smooth day to day operation from Big Sur, fast-loading and running apps, speedy video rendering and image editing, and intriguing possibilities in the realm of gaming.</p><p> While the numbers Apple has tossed around have been impressive, and my own experience with the M1 hardware was almost uniformly positive, I had to run some benchmarks. First up, I ran the Cinebench multi-core test. The Mac mini achieved a score of 7,662 in that test, putting it between an Intel Xeon E5-2697 at 3GHz and an X5650 Xeon processor at 3.66Ghz. That’s almost within spitting distance of an eight core AMD Ryzen 7 1700X, but only about half the score of a 1950X Threadripper.</p><p> For a processor in a mini-computer at this price range, the M1 turned in decent enough multi-core numbers. When running the single-core Cinebench test though, decent goes right out the window. In that test, the M1 Mac mini scored 1,521, which is the second highest score Cinebench has on record.</p><p> I also ran a few gaming benchmarks from GFXBench Metal. I started with Car Chase, which is a benchmark that simulates a 3D game with advanced shaders, lighting effects, and more. The M1 Mac mini scored a decent 60.44fps in that test, which would be entirely playable if we were dealing with a real game and not a benchmark. It scored a nearly identical 60fps in the less-intense T-Rex benchmark.</p><p> In addition to GFXBench, I also ran the WildLife benchmark from 3DMark that’s designed for iOS, made possible by Big Sur’s native support for iOS applications. In that test, the Mac mini scored 17,930 overall and registered 107fps. Both numbers were a bit higher than the MacBook Air managed on the same test, which is understandable since the Mac mini GPU has one more core.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H6vCqcN2s5HOQG5MJWawrPxairg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-6-cd1693bee2f4429fafd1a57ecffbce81.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151864/7443" target="_top" id="2151864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gaming-Limited-but-promising"><a href="#Gaming-Limited-but-promising" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Limited but promising"></a>Gaming: Limited but promising</h2><p> This is one area where Apple’s decision to switch from Intel to their own bespoke silicon is unlikely to pay off for a while. The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it. That means the already anemic Mac gaming scene could be even more anemic until devs see a reason to put substantial resources into games that run natively on the ARM-based M1 hardware. In the long term, cross-compatibility between macOS and iOS apps could end up being a massive game-changer.</p><p> Since the gaming scene was already anemic on macOS, a lot of gaming on Macs is really done in Windows via Bootcamp. If you do a lot of gaming on your current Mac, you’re probably familiar with big tentpole video game titles that never make it off Windows in the first place, and afterthought macOS ports that are poorly optimized and run a whole lot better if you just play the same game on the same hardware in Windows.</p><p> With the switch to ARM-based architecture, the Mac mini no longer provides the option to run Windows alongside macOS, so that gaming option is gone. Windows can’t run on this hardware, so the only way to play Windows-only games is through a virtual machine environment, which is not a good way to play games. That means you just won’t be able to play some games if you rely on a Mac mini, or any M1-based Mac, as your only gaming rig.</p><p> The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it.</p><p> However, thanks to Rosetta 2, the Mac mini can play any game that’s designed to run in macOS on an Intel machine. There’s some level of performance cost involved, but I wasn’t able to notice it with any of the games I played. Notably, I was able to run<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using Rosetta 2 and then download and play macOS games through Steam seamlessly.</p><p> Civilization 6 is currently in the middle of a nearly year-long content drip, and I was able to fire it up via Rosetta 2 and Steam with zero issues. Even with the world size cranked up all the way, more civs than recommended, and maxed out city states, the M1 sailed along effortlessly with fast load times and tolerably snappy AI turns.</p><p> For something less demanding, yet much more fast-paced, I fired up Rocket League. Though Psyonix technically no longer supports macOS, I was able to download and launch through Steam, and set up a local match. It ran without a hitch, with zero slowdown or stuttering as the cars zipped around the arena at breakneck pace.</p><p> The last game I tried out was Streets of Rage 4, the long-awaited fourth entry in the Streets of Rage series that finally arrived earlier this year. The fast-paced online brawler ran just as smoothly as it does on my Windows gaming rig, with no lag or slow down at all.</p><p> Aside from lack of support from game developers, the only real drawback here in terms of gaming comes from the HDMI port itself. While the M1 Mac mini can pump out<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. That’s fine for most casual gamers, but anyone who has fallen in love with their high refresh rate monitor will experience a bit of pain here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657396/16446" target="_top" id="1657396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657396/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Ready-for-work"><a href="#Productivity-Ready-for-work" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Ready for work"></a>Productivity: Ready for work</h2><p> The great thing about the Mac mini line is that it’s always been so flexible. You can use a Mac mini for work, but the size and relative affordability of the hardware means you aren’t locked into using it that way. If you do aim to use an M1 Mac mini for work though, it’s more than up to the task. Native apps and the operating system itself run fast and smooth as you could possibly hope, with none of the sitting around looking at spinning beach balls that you may have gotten used to with older hardware.</p><p> Thanks to the emulation offered by Rosetta 2, the M1 offers most tools people will need for productivity. If you currently run an app in macOS on older hardware, Rosetta 2 will allow you to run it on an M1 Mac mini until a native app arrives. And even if a native app doesn’t arrive, your productivity shouldn’t be affected too much.</p><p> I was able to run apps like Photoshop and Lightroom through Rosetta 2 without a hitch or even a hint of slowdown.</p><p> Those are both examples of apps that will get native -versions, according to Adobe, but they run pretty well under Rosetta 2 in the meantime.</p><p> Multitasking also works flawlessly, and I was able to juggle an impressive number of browser windows, intensive apps like Photoshop and Handbrake, voice and video chat over Discord, and more without running into any real problems.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it"><a href="#Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It’s there if you need it"></a>Audio: It’s there if you need it</h2><p> The M1 Mac mini is great in almost every category, but audio isn’t one of them. There’s a speaker inside that sleek aluminum block, but it isn’t one you’ll care to listen to. It’s tinny and hollow, and absolutely a placeholder for more capable external speakers. You’ll want to hook up headphonesor some kind of speakers or soundbar shortly after setting the M1 Mac mini up, because the built-in speaker isn’t really even suitable for watching YouTube videos, let alone listening to music or streaming your favorite shows or movies.</p><p> The M1 Mac mini does include a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back along with built-in Bluetooth, so you have a lot of options. Just make sure to budget for some sort of external speakers or headphones, because you don’t want to get stuck with the built-in speaker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OZrKjTPGUmo00carhaedBa9WhTU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-5-bc84da59dfdf440c8d53a096509c232b.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity"></a>Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</h2><p> The Mac mini includes a wired gigabit Ethernet jack, support for Bluetooth 5.0, and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network card that’s also 801.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac compatible. Performance from the wired and wireless networking options was uniformly strong, with fast download speeds and no issues streaming 4K video or video chatting.</p><p> To test the M1 Mac mini’s network capabilities, I used a gigabit connection from Mediacom that measured just shy of 1Gbps at the modem at the time of testing. First I hooked up to the router via Ethernet and checked the speed using the Speedtest app from Ookla. With the wired connection, the M1 Mac mini turned in an impressive 937Mbps down, which is one of the fastest measurements I’ve seen on this connection. At the same time, it measured an upload speed of 63.7Mbps, which is close to the upper limit of this connection.</p><p> I also tested the wireless connection, hooking the M1 Mac mini to my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/eero-pro-mesh-wi-fi-system-review-4797008" >Eero mesh network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Big Sur was built specifically for this hardware and to integrate seamlessly with Rosetta 2 for running legacy Intel macOS apps, and a number of first party Apple apps also run natively, but that’s about it at launch.</p><p> I’ve already touched on it a few times, but the biggest casualty of Apple’s move to in-house ARM-based silicon is that the hardware doesn’t let you dual boot Windows, and x86 emulation for Windows apps is also a no-go. The good news is that a new version of Parallels Desktop for Mac that will run on M1 hardware is on the way, but some apps require dual booting, or run poorly in a virtual machine environment, so that won’t solve every problem for everyone.</p><p> Software is the biggest stumbling block for M1 hardware during these early days, as there isn’t a whole lot out there that’s actually designed to run on Apple Silicon.</p><p> The bottom line is that if you currently rely on Bootcamp for a Windows application or utility that you need for work, or even just for gaming, the M1 Mac mini just won’t run that software for you.

The baseline M1 Mac mini is actually hundreds of dollars cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware, which is remarkable considering how much more powerful it is. The last Intel Mac mini was already a good deal, so the even cheaper M1 Mac mini looks even better in comparison.

The two mini desktops share an identical form factor, with the Intel version coming in Space Gray and the M1 version finished in Silver. The Intel Mac mini has a base price of $1,099 compared to $699 or $899 for the M1 Mac mini.</p><p> The Intel Mac mini is more similar to the $899 model of the M1 hardware since both come with 512GB of storage. They also both have 8GB of RAM. Where the M1 Mac mini has the 8-core M1 chip, the Intel version includes a 6-core Intel Core i5 and integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630.</p><p> In terms of performance, the M1 Mac mini blows the Intel version out of the water. The Intel version does include a couple extra Thunderbolt ports though, and it can do one thing the M1 version can’t: run Windows via Bootcamp.</p><p> If you don’t have any need to run Windows apps, then there’s no real question. The M1 Mac mini is superior, and it costs less. The Intel Mac mini is worth considering if you absolutely need to run Windows apps and don’t mind the extra cost, but the question then becomes whether the Mac mini is really the best platform to be running those Windows apps considering how much more expensive it is than a pure Windows machine of similar capabilities.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mini-pcs-4047271" >The Best Home Theater PCs of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you’re weighing different options, be sure to check out our guide for the best laptops.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If all you need is a Mac, the M1 Mac mini is your destination.</strong></p><p> The Apple Mac mini with M1 is a tremendously impressive piece of hardware, offering staggering performance at an affordable price. The only real catch here is that in leaving Intel behind, Apple may have left you in the lurch.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006960/19272" target="_top" id="2006960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049387/7443" target="_top" id="2049387">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049387" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049387/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100534/7443" target="_top" id="2100534">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100534" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100534/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50).

Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Product Brand  Epic Games</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>PC Minimum Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel HD 4000</li><li>PC Recommended Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core Core i5 2.8 Ghz, Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Mac Minimum Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel Iris Pro 5200</li><li>Mac Recommended Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i5 2.8 Ghz,Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Platforms  PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch</li><li>Languages Supported  English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), Turkish</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-engage-enthusiastically-earn-enticingly-the-entrepreneurial-editors-handbook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Engage Enthusiastically, Earn Enticingly The Entrepreneurial Editor’s Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-best-5-android-video-capture-apps-for-screen-recording-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best 5 Android Video Capture Apps for Screen Recording for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-superior-mics-for-video-blogging-professionals/"><u>[Updated] Superior Mics for Video Blogging Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-doesnt-mean-inferior-discover-how-xiaomis-mi-smart-band-4-became-my-go-to-fitness-gadget/"><u>Affordable Doesn't Mean Inferior: Discover How Xiaomi's Mi Smart Band 4 Became My Go-To Fitness Gadget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/expert-insight-a-deep-dive-into-razer-stealth-13s-cutting-edge-ultrabook-tech/"><u>Expert Insight: A Deep Dive Into Razer Stealth 13’S Cutting-Edge Ultrabook Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/first-impressions-can-the-nokia-31-live-up-to-its-promise-as-a-starter-device/"><u>First Impressions: Can the Nokia 3.1 Live Up to Its Promise as a Starter Device?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/google-nest-wi-fi-speed-test-review-seamless-multi-room-connectivity-unveiled/"><u>Google Nest Wi-Fi Speed Test Review: Seamless Multi-Room Connectivity Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/google-wifi-unveiled-the-essential-home-wi-fi-system-that-delivers-quality-and-reliability-to-everyone/"><u>Google WiFi Unveiled – The Essential Home Wi-Fi System That Delivers Quality and Reliability to Everyone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-oppo-reno-11-5g-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Oppo Reno 11 5G to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-on-infinix-note-30-vip-fix-now-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Infinix Note 30 VIP?
