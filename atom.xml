As streaming services have become commonplace, some subscribers don’t have access to live TV and broadcast channels. Some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provide advanced features, but their designs leave something to be desired. I tested the attractive Antop AT-127 Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a worthy option.</p><h2 id="Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish"><a href="#Design-Reversible-faux-wood-finish" class="headerlink" title="Design: Reversible faux wood finish"></a><strong>Design: Reversible faux wood finish</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 is one of the better-looking antennas I’ve come across. It’s a thin, plastic rectangular antenna that measures 13 inches wide by nine inches tall. At 0.02 inches in thickness, it’s almost paper-thin, but the plastic feels sturdy enough to withstand regular wear and tear.</p><p> The antenna is reversible, with a light oak finish on one side, and darker wood color on the other. It looks less like an eyesore or something you need to hide, and more like an attractive component, you’re willing to display. The pre-attached coaxial cable comes out of the bottom, which is ideal. You can’t remove the cable from the antenna, which isn’t great for storage, but it does promote stable connectivity.</p><p> The antenna comes with a stand for placement on a desk or entertainment center. It also comes with double-sided adhesives, so you can hang it on a wall or window. The adhesives are extremely sticky—when I pulled the antenna off of my wall, the paint came off along with it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RWXekalxAMy_w61EH_Getqbfiy0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-2-24f94c63d6164dc7a54542cc1e4262c9.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Easier-than-most"><a href="#Setup-Easier-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Easier than most"></a><strong>Setup: Easier than most</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is relatively intuitive. You just connect the antenna to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connection on your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to twist onto the threading. This makes for easier setup because you don’t have to struggle behind your TV with trying to screw on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/coaxial-vs-optical-digital-cable-3134605" >coaxial cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Once you connect the antenna’s cable to your TV, you’ll need to find the best placement. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the setup process. My test home is in a wooded area, and I found the best placement was near or directly on the window. However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >to improve your antenna’s reception <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s usually a good idea to place the antenna high up in a room close to the home’s exterior (and nearest to the transmitter towers) and to avoid obstacles like walls and tree cover.</p><p> The antenna has an easy-push connector, instead of a connector you have to screw onto the coax threading.</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 supports UHF and VHF signals. Overall, it works pretty smoothly, though some channels might have look pixelated for a few seconds when you flip to them or take a second or two to fully load.</p><p> The attached coax cable isn’t as long as I’ve seen on other similarly-priced antennas, but it is long enough (10 feet) to place the antenna up high without an extender.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5o1YIUg5PeQto5h_Mm6uuK9o5JQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-3-7f7ec909a6b944cabe60862b51a6ba2b.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137211/26400" target="_top" id="2137211">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137211" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137211/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Could-be-better"><a href="#Range-Could-be-better" class="headerlink" title="Range: Could be better"></a><strong>Range: Could be better</strong></h2><p> My test home is in a rural area, and there’s a lot of tree cover on the property. The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, which was enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.</p><p> On my first attempt, I used the included stand, and the auto-programming only picked up four channels. When I placed the antenna on a window facing the TV transmitter tower, however, the omnidirectional HD antenna picked up 23 channels, which is a good amount considering the area.</p><p> The omnidirectional Antop AT-127 has a 40-mile range, enough to pick up local channels from neighboring cities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Mid-range"><a href="#Price-Mid-range" class="headerlink" title="Price: Mid-range"></a><strong>Price: Mid-range</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 retails for $35, which is middle of the road for an indoor TV antenna with the Antop’s specs. Some 50-mile (or longer) range antennas sell for as little as $20 or as much as $100, but the cheaper antennas usually don’t look as nice as the AT-127.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Gyp2hHNkH22HeYhnm37WRKC_MHU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Antop-AT-127-TV-Antenna-4-baa9b55de12c4a91aa6baad4c8d86272.jpg"                      alt="Antop AT-127"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Antop-AT-127-vs-AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna"><a href="#Antop-AT-127-vs-AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Antop AT-127 vs. AmazonBasics Flat TV Antenna"></a><strong>Antop AT-127 vs. AmazonBasics Flat TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> You can find indoor antennas for less than $15 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075ZQXB26/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4845583%7Cna0f30cabffec4337b279a8df3e4c99b015%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The inexpensive webcam makes it possible for just about anyone to make a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apps-for-free-video-chat-3426695" >video call, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stream games on Twitch, or to record a quick video for YouTube. A good webcam has HD resolution, quality sound, and is easy to use. We tested the Logitech C615 Webcam to see whether it can deliver what you need to start recording your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/86PZ5XCiq91ihr7-8UNmM5io9pY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_4_Final_Horiz-bad356a5002b4156859dca672e8a8eb4.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Design-Flexible-foldable-design"><a href="#Design-Flexible-foldable-design" class="headerlink" title="Design: Flexible, foldable design"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>Flexible, foldable design</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 is a compact webcam. The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C2UBXNFmxG8nA0udy1IprMH4LBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_9_Final_Horiz-1af52951f8704af9b76d7dd1ec9744a9.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123728/7443" target="_top" id="2123728">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123728" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123728/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive HD camera"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive HD camera</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost.

But there’s a reason it retails so cheaply; it’s a nightmare to use, the audio quality is torturous, and the camera doesn’t approach the advertised 12 MP. Despite being nearly $60 more expensive, the C615 is the obvious winner here.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/docooler-usb-20-12-megapixel-review-4784227" >Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>Genius 120-degree Webcam</em> :</strong> The Genius 120-degree Webcam is a full HD model with a wide-angle lens. Even though its actual field of view is well short of the advertised 120 degrees (in reality, it’s closer to 90), it still captures a much wider shot than the Logitech C615, giving it a clear advantage for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with large groups of people.

It has all the charm you’d expect from a Nintendo console. It takes seconds to start up, its menu system is easy to figure out, and its game catalog is fantastic.</p><p> It’s starting to show its age with slower performance on some games but it’s worth the longer loading times.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>OLED screen looks fantastic</li><li>Extensive catalog of exclusive games</li><li>Can connect it to TV</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Hardware is starting to show its age</li><li>No performance updates beyond the display</li></ul><p> Nothing about the Nintendo Switch OLED is clunky. The only ads you’ll see are for Nintendo services, so it’s very family-friendly. Game options include all your childhood favorites, including plenty of new versions of Mario, like Super Mario Odyssey and Super Mario Wonder, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the Legend of Zelda franchise.</p><p> There’s some comfort here, but the Nintendo Switch OLED still has room for more adult games like Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy.</p><p> You can<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-nintendo-switch-controller-5218934" >leave games in sleep mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> so you can quickly resume where you left off, which is useful if you need to pause while traveling.</p><p> Back home, you can plug the console into your TV via the included dock to gather around as a family to play multiplayer games or enjoy a single-player session on a bigger screen. This feels less essential solo than with previous Switches, as the OLED screen looks great, but it’s nice to have the option.</p><p> Online play requires<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-nintendo-switch-online-4175784" >Nintendo Switch Online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a paid service that offers emulated versions of old favorites from past consoles.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, Wired, T3, Tom’s Guide, Digital Trends, and CNET recommend the Nintendo Switch OLED.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> 90% of buyers on Amazon have rated the Nintendo Switch OLED five stars, with the console having an average score of 4.8 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Also-Great"><a href="#Also-Great" class="headerlink" title="Also Great"></a>Also Great</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >Valve Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0UYqsaz73PWhH6z5ksLDbIhSU-w=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SteamDeckOLED2-3ea64c8ac24943b5b4eb2e57f9ffe6f7.jpg" >Steam Deck OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8656300%7Cn828e9c21ba084df1b24d3ffdd45b85b813%7CB0BBQRYN9M" >$450 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Valve-Steam-Deck-64-GB/2237665775" >$459 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" >$399 at Steampowered.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Steam Deck makes PC gaming truly portable and much simpler than ever before. It’s all within a sleek and easy to hold shell with a great screen whether you go LED or OLED. As with the Switch, you can always dock it, and even install Windows if you want a full portable PC.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Steam Deck is effectively a portable PC. Designed like a Nintendo Switch, it provides easy access to your Steam library thanks to running SteamOS, Valve’s Linux-based operating system.</p><p> While you might be thinking, a gaming laptop does all that, the Steam Deck is far more portable than any gaming laptop.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Huge range of games via Steam</li><li>More accessible PC gaming</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Battery life can be poor</li><li>Customization can get very complicated</li></ul><p> Because the Steam Deck is built like a Nintendo Switch, it feels very portable. Its either 7-inch LCD or 7.4-inch OLED screen ensures you can see plenty of what’s going on without the bulk of a 14- —to 17-inch laptop screen.</p><p> Due to its size, it won’t play games at the highest detail level but it still looks good and aligns well with the screen size involved. You can always dock it with your TV, like the Nintendo Switch, if you prefer.</p><p> Regular PC gamers like me will already have extensive Steam libraries to explore, and there are often sales on the Steam store, meaning the Steam Deck can provide good value over time.</p><p> Not every game on the store is compatible with the Steam Deck, but the number is growing rapidly.</p><p> Technically minded people can also spend time customizing the device, either installing Windows to extend their options or other game launchers like Battle.net or the Epic Games Store Launcher. It’s fun to tinker with.</p><p> Battery life could be better, but the Steam Deck truly is a PC in your hands, so that’s to be expected. Otherwise, it’s a lot of fun, and I’ve enjoyed catching up with my Steam library in a couch-friendly format.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> The Verge, Forbes, IGN, PCGamer, and Wired have all recommended the Steam Deck with the Steam Deck OLED considered a particular highlight.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Steam Deck has sold over 3 million units on the Steam website. Relatively recently featured on Amazon, it has 86% four- or five-star ratings across 564 reviews.</li></ul><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/B5s9keNJcOmzNUWzyuCLkCGE1fc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/HyperMegaTechSuperPocket1-e0c2f7f305d143ad9cf64143fbe17afd.jpg" >Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hyper-Mega-Tech-Capcom-Super-Pocket-Retro-System/5194946970" >$60 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/blaze-entertainment-hyper-mega-tech-taito-super-pocket-green-black/6549862.p?skuId=6549862" >$56 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Old enough to remember the Nintendo Game Boy?

It feels like holding a Game Boy, and it’s very lightweight.</p><p> True to its name, the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket fits in your pocket. The controls take a brief time to get used to, as they’re quite close together and there are a handful of buttons on the back panel, but they’re reasonably well placed.</p><p> The Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket is far more than just whichever edition you buy, as it also supports Evercade cartridges. There are over 45 cartridges available, providing access to over 500 retro games at relatively low prices.</p><p> Titles include Duke Nukem, Tomb Raider, Flashback, and Pac-Man. There’s a lot of fun here, especially if you’re an older gamer.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, GamesRadar, Stuff, and The Guardian have all highly rated the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> Between the two models, the Hyper Mega Tech Super Pocket has an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Amazon. 84% of customers have rated the Capcom version 4 or 5 stars, with 90% rating the Taito the same score.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-I-Test"><a href="#How-I-Test" class="headerlink" title="How I Test"></a>How I Test</h2><p> I reviewed every handheld gaming console featured here over a number of weeks.

The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel promises to make that a reality with an HD camera for the lowest cost in its class. Can this dirt-cheap<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> deliver on its promise to connect us in HD?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YIcu00ga1PIrZWJzNk-mS5C4z-A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_5_Final_Horiz-23ef27f359f24e919ebb2f47f9089957.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Design-Flimsy-and-difficult-to-use"><a href="#Design-Flimsy-and-difficult-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Design: Flimsy and difficult to use"></a><strong>Design: Flimsy and difficult to use</strong></h2><p> The first thing we noticed about the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is how cheap it feels. The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135359/19272" target="_top" id="2135359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135359/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014851/22899" target="_top" id="2014851">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014851" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014851/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low. The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115950/19272" target="_top" id="2115950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115950/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short"></a><strong>Competition: Falls short</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Logitech C270</em> :</strong> The Logitech C270 is a low-cost webcam that goes for $40 MSRP, though you can frequently find it for approximately $20. For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR sound card was a great card in 2013. In 2019, however, the ZxR has started to lag behind the competition. It provides pretty clear audio, but it requires two PCIe slots and costs $250 MSRP. Compare this to products from other audio card manufacturers, such as ASUS and EVGA, which been able to provide better audio performance for as little as $160. That said, the Sound Blaster ZxR isn’t without merits: it has a lot of inputs and outputs, extensive EQ software, and still produces quality sound. It also has features gamers need, such as treble boost and voice isolation, and it accommodates 6.3mm auxiliary input and output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U_vmwZDe5HbbungQ5L2hzf2LVto=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-4-b0d1cca56ec04a61b83e20d1cecf2aea.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-convenient"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-convenient" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and convenient"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and convenient</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR features a black and red chassis on its main and daughter boards, brightly accented in gold around the transistors and back plate. Together, the cards have enough outputs to natively support a 5.1 surround sound speaker system. They have 2 RCA outputs, 2 3.5mm outputs, two RCA inputs, one optical TOSLINK input, one optical TOSLINK output, one 6.3mm microphone input, and one 6.3 headphone output jack. The ZxR also comes with an Audio Control Module (ACM), which is Creative Labs’ take on an amplifier and on extending the 6.3mm connections. It has both 3.5mm and 6.3mm inputs and outputs so you can choose where you’d like to plug in your headphones and microphone. On the ACM’s face lies a big, plastic volume knob that controls the headphones’ loudness.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Some-odd-decisions"><a href="#Hardware-Some-odd-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Hardware: Some odd decisions"></a><strong>Hardware: Some odd decisions</strong></h2><p> For users who may own higher impedance headphones, the amplifier can comfortably drive headphones with up to a 600 ohm impedance. Unfortunately, the volume control on the ACM works passively by altering the output impedance, which can distort audio on headphones with high inductance like the Sennheiser HD800 (see “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-output-impedance-4690092" >How Low Should Output Impedance Be? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ”). A better and only slightly more costly solution for Creative Labs would have been to have the knob control the ZxR’s in-built volume control rather than try to do it passively. The HD800 sounded fine when plugged directly into the sound card and using the system volume control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1t84P8oe4qch2aJ6lknx0lwunWw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-2-de43d07bd3db40a282f55347c8956c9a.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup"><a href="#Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup"></a><strong>Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup</strong></h2><p> To install the hardware, we popped open our mid-size PC tower and inserted the sound card and daughter board into two available PCIe slots. Creative Labs had the foresight to build the main card with a PCIe 1x slots, giving the user flexibility in where they connect their cards to the motherboard. Once the cards were secured, we plugged the headphones and microphone into the corresponding jacks.</p><p> It’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP.</p><p> Unfortunately, configuring Creative Labs’ drivers and software suite was a much less intuitive process. The ZxR’s outputs are controlled via the Sound Blaster Z-series Software, where users can select whether they’re listening with their headphones or their speakers, apply EQ effects, and more. By default, the software is set to output to speakers with several different EQ effects turned on. We had to manually switch it to headphone output and turn off EQ; the software does not automatically detect which jacks are in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6uorHzKoJdW1FBv0B5ZfeoE8XzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-3-17de2156e4294b5c85f151bd0cd97aa4.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115913/19272" target="_top" id="2115913">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115913" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115913/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Excellent-sound"><a href="#Audio-Excellent-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Excellent sound"></a><strong>Audio: Excellent sound</strong></h2><p> Once the EQ effects are turned off, the Sound Blaster ZxR provides beautiful sound. While it wasn’t quite as clean or crisp as an enthusiast audiophile amplifier, such as the OPPO HA-1, it was solid for a system that costs a quarter of the HA-1’s price. On the HD-800s, the bass came across slightly muddy, but the ZxR provides solid quality for consumer-grade headphones like the Sennheiser GSP300 or the Sony MDR-7506. As our our<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/headphones-buying-guide-4172763" >headphone buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggests, most headphones under $250 will not be sensitive enough to meaningfully distinguish between the ZxR and the HA-1.</p><p> Should you happen to own dynamic headphones, you should find their impedance curve. Dynamic headphones with a high impedance may be distorted by the ACM, thanks to the ACM’s high resistance. How your headphones will be affected depends on their impedance curve: for the HD800s, for example, there is a peak at 100Hz (this range captures electric bass and the lower octaves of guitars), so the upper bass range is boosted relative to the other frequencies in the audio. Increasing the volume on the ACM reduces its output resistance and in turn reduces the distortion, but it may be easier to plug equipment directly into the sound card and use the system volume instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1CZw4BSxxTqlBF1kxT0_rl73XCU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-5-e1022e9adc854517af98407c4be32691.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options with mixed utility"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options with mixed utility</strong></h2><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package. Here, you can EQ any frequency between 20 and 20,000 Hz or activate “Crystallization,” “Scout Mode,” and “Theater Mode.” Crystallization adds punch to the audio’s treble, making voices stand out against the background. Theater Mode is similar to Crystallization, but it tries to_only_ boost voices instead of the entire treble range. We found it great for watching videos. Meanwhile, Scout Mode is squarely aimed at gamers. It theoretically makes enemy noises like footsteps louder.</p><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package.</p><p> When testing Scout Mode in_Overwatch_ , we did not find the adjustment helpful; Scout Mode made our enemies’ and our allies’ movements louder, making it harder to tell where the enemy was coming from. Without adjustments,<em>Overwatch’s</em> audio already makes the enemies’ movements louder than your allies’, making Scout Mode not only ineffective but an active detriment to gameplay. Other games that strongly rely on situational awareness have also likely invested the time into making enemies’ movements noticeable. Overall the software modifications Sound Blaster provides are situationally useful but not the comprehensive range of options we’d like to see at this price point.</p><h2 id="Price-Unjustified-expense"><a href="#Price-Unjustified-expense" class="headerlink" title="Price: Unjustified expense"></a><strong>Price: Unjustified expense</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR retails for about $250, on par with other high-end consumer audio cards. Its 6.3mm audio and microphone jacks, coupled with support for headphone impedance of up to 600 ohms, gives the listener flexibility in the rest of their audio setup: no need for 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapters or extension cords. One major hardware disappointment is its lack of 7.1 surround compatibility, which is something many sound card enthusiasts prize in a high-end sound card. There are also a number of other products with better sound quality for less than the ZxR’s $250 MSRP.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short of less expensive options"></a><strong>Competition:</strong> <strong>Falls short of less expensive options</strong></h2><p> As we’ve already emphasized, it’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP. You can find a number of sound cards for significantly less that provide competitive performance, though they generally don’t offer the same robust software package as the ZxR.</p><p> For a fraction of the price ($99 MSRP), you could get your hands on the Schitt Audio Fulla, an external DAC&#x2F;AMP set that covers 16 to 300 ohm headphones with plenty of power and has a clean, no-nonsense design. While it doesn’t offer the level of software support as the ZxR (those who want to dive deep into live microphone sound manipulation may not find what they need), for the consumer looking to delve into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hi-res-audio-4134630" >Hi-Fi audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this is an excellent deal.</p><p> At the $215 mark, still well below the price of the ZxR, the EVGA Nu audio card performs as well as external DAC&#x2F;AMPs in the $1,000 range. It also has minimalist software which Sound Blaster devotees may find a little feature-light, but even given the dearth of software options the EVGA Nu is the clear winner.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/evga-nu-audio-card-review-4769828" >EVGA Nu Audio Card Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> For about $160, the Asus Strix Raid PRO delivers better audio than the Sound Blaster ZxR and a control module that’s more useful than the ACM. The Strix’s “control box” has a button to turn EQ presets on and off, to change output between headphones and speakers, and all the features of the ACM (save 6.3mm jacks). The EQ button, which Asus calls the Raid button, is especially useful for gamers to switch between modes in-game.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-strix-raid-pro-review-4769832" >ASUS Strix Raid PRO Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good card that’s showing its age.</strong></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR is a quality, expensive sound card, with comprehensive software features and the hardware to power great consumer headsets and microphones. The ZxR sounds good, and gamers will not be disappointed by the ZxR’s power, but audio purists and 7.1 surround fans can find cleaner performance with fewer bells and whistles for the $250 asking price of the ZxR. It’s a card that hasn’t aged well since it’s 2013 release, and one that’s been largely overshadowed by some of its competitors in the interim.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098703/14409" target="_top" id="2098703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098703/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-z-review-4769764" >Sound Blaster Z <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-audigy-rx-review-4769814" >Sound Blaster Audigy RX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Sound Blaster ZxR</li><li>Product Brand  Creative</li><li>UPC  Model Number SB1510</li><li>Price  $250.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2013</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.6 x 4.1 x 7.9 in.</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Main Card)  6.3mm Headphone Out, 2x 3.5mm Out, 2x RCA Out, 6.3mm Microphone In</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Daughterboard)  2x 3.5mm RCA In, Optical TOSLINK In, Optical TOSLINK Out</li><li>Audio Interface  PCI Express</li><li>Frequency Response  100Hz to 20kHz (microphone); 10Hz to 45kHz (headphones)</li><li>Output Signal-to-Noise Ratio  124 dB</li><li>Headphone Amplifier  16-600 ohms</li><li>Chipset  Sound Core 3D</li><li>Digital-to-Analog Converters  Burr-Brown PCM1794 and PCM1798</li><li>Headphone Op-Amps (Swappable)  New Japan Radio NJM2114D</li><li>Headphone Driver  Texas Instruments TPA6120A2</li><li>Line Out Op-Amps (Swappable)  Texas Instruments LME49710</li><li>Capacitors  Nichicon</li><li>Software  Sound Blaster Z-Series Software</li><li>What’s Included  Sound Blaster ZxR sound card, Sound Blaster DBpro card, Sound Blaster Audio Control Module, 1Optical Cable, 1x Stereo(3.5mm)-to-RCA cable, 1x DBpro cable, Quick Start Leaflet, Installation CD containing: Drivers for Windows 7 and Windows 8, Creative Software Suite, User’s Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-the-most-compelling-ios-apps-for-psp-gaming/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unveiling the Most Compelling iOS Apps for PSP Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-advanced-strategies-for-rl-capture-success/"><u>[New] In 2024, Advanced Strategies for RL Capture Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-initiating-a-thriving-youtube-channel-avoid-these-8-essential-blunders/"><u>[New] In 2024, Initiating a Thriving YouTube Channel?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is one of the most portable and convenient travel air compressors you can buy. Its intuitive design allows anyone to fill up a low tire easily. It also has additional safety features that allow you to be seen at night and, if necessary, signal that you’re in distress. And when you’re done with it, it’s easy to pack up and store. Tradeoffs for these benefits include a small<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >LCD display <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a short air hose, but given its intended function, those are trivial concerns.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Simple-compact-intuitive"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Simple-compact-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Simple, compact, intuitive"></a><strong>Design and Features: Simple, compact, intuitive</strong></h2><p> At just 7.5 inches wide, 2.5 inches tall and 6 inches long, this is the smallest, most compact portable tire inflator we tested. When it’s in its carrying case, it only weighs 2 pounds, 31 ounces. Even small children should be able to carry it. If you need a portable tire inflator but don’t have a lot of space, this pump is exactly what you want.</p><p> The control panel is as about as basic and simple as it gets. The functions of its large buttons are clearly marked, which makes it incredibly intuitive. Even those who don’t read the owners manual will be able to learn how to use it effectively in just a few seconds.</p><p> Like much of the competition, this air compressor has an auto-shutoff feature (Jaco calls it SmartPressure) that allows you to preset the tire pressure you want before the pump goes to work.</p><p> The control panel’s 1.5-inch LCD is the smallest display we saw among the devices we tested, nevertheless, it’s perfectly readable in the sun and at night. It displays tire pressure in PSI (pound per square inch)I, BAR (atmospheric pressure), and Kpa (kilopascal). If you live in the United States, chances are that you’ll exclusively use PSI. But if you ever need to measure pressure in the metric system or SI (International System of Units), you’ll be glad you have the ability.</p><p> Like much of the competition, this air compressor has an auto-shutoff feature (Jaco calls it SmartPressure) that allows you to preset the tire pressure you want before the pump goes to work. When you turn it on, it will pump air until the desired pressure is achieved and turn itself off. This is great because it means you don’t have to constantly monitor it to make sure you don’t overfill your tires.</p><p> Most portable tire inflators draw their power from a 12V adapter attached to the power cord. The SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is no different. Simply plug the adapter into your car’s 12V socket (cigarette lighter), turn your car on and the pump powers up immediately. This is a great convenience compared to pumps like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which requires you to hook it up to your car’s battery, jumper-cable style.</p><p> The built-in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is more useful than any of the portable tire compressors we tested. It not only illuminates the tire you’re inflating but also much of the surrounding area. Additionally, you can set the light to flash hazard signals so oncoming traffic can spot you better at night. It even has the ability to flash S.O.S. in morse code to signal a serious emergency that you need immediate assistance with.</p><p> Unlike some of its competition, the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator has excellent cord and hose management. The air hose and power cord have separate compartments built into the pump’s housing, and they both fit snugly for easy storage. Another portable air compressor we tested, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator, has extremely awkward cord management that results in frustration and cables jutting out the side of the device when it’s not in use.</p><p> The functions of its large buttons are clearly marked, which makes it incredibly intuitive. Even those who don’t read owners manual will be able to learn how to use it effectively in just a few seconds.</p><p> The air-hose on this portable compressor is a scant 24 inches, which means that you have to be within two feet of the tire or object you’re inflating. This is fine if you only plan on using it for regular tire pressure maintenance and “just-in-case” scenarios. Fortunately, the 10-foot power cord provides enough range to reach every tire on your vehicle.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-less-than-three-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Up-and-running-in-less-than-three-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Up and running in less than three minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process: Up and running in less than three minutes</strong></h2><p> Jaco provides a brief, but informative user manual tucked in the carrying case. Despite how intuitive this pump is to use, you should take five minutes to read the whole thing. During testing, we timed how long it takes to get out of your driver’s seat, retrieve the pump from the trunk, connect it to power, attach it to an under-inflated tire, set the pressure and start the pump. On average, the whole process took about 1 minute, 30 seconds.</p><p> Simply plug the adapter into your car’s 12V socket (cigarette lighter), turn your car on and the pump powers up immediately.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-across-the-highways-of-America"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-across-the-highways-of-America" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable across the highways of America"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable across the highways of America</strong></h2><p> In order to recreate the situations that you’re most likely to use a portable tire inflator, we took the models we tested on a long road trip through the states of Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. When we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations along the way, we deflated the tires on our car to 20 PSI—the point where they are dangerously low to drive on.</p><p> We timed how long it took the Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator to re-inflate the tires to the recommended 32 PSI. On average, it took about 2 minutes, 13 seconds to fill the tires. This represents the slowest fill time of the portable air compressors we tested, while the fastest average we recorded was 55 seconds.</p><p> Unlike some of its competition, the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator has excellent cord and hose management.</p><p> We checked the accuracy of the pressure gauge by comparing its readings to that of a simple pencil-style gauge. Each time we took a reading, they matched within a 0.5 PSI range. That’s as about as close to perfect that you can expect.</p><p> Any air compressor is going to generate a lot of noise, so we used a sound meter to measure how loud this tire inflator gets while running. We recorded sound levels up to 97 decibels, but it was usually a steady 95 decibels. Although the sound is grating, you won’t have to wear protection unless you plan to have it continually running for hours.</p><p> That also shouldn’t be an issue because the pump automatically cycles down after 30 minutes of continuous use, and you’ll have to wait until it cools down to use it again. This shouldn’t be a problem, since you can conceivably fill all four of your car’s tires in under 10 minutes. You’d have to inflate something exceptionally large to run this pump for that long.</p><h2 id="Price-On-the-expensive-end-but-worth-it-for-the-peace-of-mind"><a href="#Price-On-the-expensive-end-but-worth-it-for-the-peace-of-mind" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the expensive end, but worth it for the peace of mind"></a><strong>Price: On the expensive end, but worth it for the peace of mind</strong></h2><p> With a list price of $90, this is the most expensive portable tire inflator we tested, but it’s typically on sale for half the price. That makes it more reasonable, especially if you need a portable compressor but are really tight on space. Or if you want to ensure maximum safety and visibility at night. But it certainly isn’t a budget model like the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump.</p><p> It’s impossible to predict how long a product will last after just a few days or using it, however, the warranty period is a good indicator of the long-term durability. Jaco offers a lifetime warranty on this compressor, so it should last a really long time, or at least until you forget it’s still under warranty.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Jaco-SmartPro-Digital-Tire-Inflator-vs-Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Jaco-SmartPro-Digital-Tire-Inflator-vs-Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator vs. Kensun Portable Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator vs. Kensun Portable Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> We tested this the SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator side-by-side with the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator. Although the Kensun is about twice as large as the Jaco, they’re designed to do the same thing. For example, they both draw power from your car’s 12V socket, but if you want to get away from your car, the Kensun comes with an AC power cord that you can plug into a wall socket. This makes the Kensun a much more versatile pump. And while the built-in light on the Kensun provides great illumination at night, it lacks the hazard and emergency lights you get with Jaco.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/kensun-portable-tire-inflator-review-4776821" >Kensun Portable Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The best tire inflator you can buy with tons of features and value.</strong></p><p> The Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator is a great addition to the jumper cables and triangle reflectors in your trunk. Its focus on safety, portability, and accuracy makes it very attractive for people looking to be prepared, and you can usually find it on sale for a reasonable price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135348/19272" target="_top" id="2135348">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135348" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135348/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Pump</li><li>Product Brand  Jaco</li><li>UPC  X000UZJE09</li><li>Price  $89.99</li><li>Release Date  September 2015</li><li>Weight  2.05 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.5 x 2.5 x 6 in.</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tactical-approach-to-effortless-ipad-screen-records/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Tactical Approach to Effortless iPad Screen Records</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-guide-to-viewing-vr-films-and-games-on-ios/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Guide to Viewing VR Films & Games on IOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-dizzy-with-design-mastering-upside-down-imagery/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Dizzy with Design Mastering Upside Down Imagery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-boosting-android-video-brilliance/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Boosting Android Video Brilliance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-wonders-the-unseen-disadvantages-in-vr-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beyond Wonders The Unseen Disadvantages in VR for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-maximize-engagement-with-proper-youtube-video-dimensions/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Engagement with Proper YouTube Video Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/hp-stream-14-in-depth-analysis-balancing-cost-and-performance/"><u>HP Stream 14 In-Depth Analysis: Balancing Cost and Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-record-complete-page-display/"><u>In 2024, Record Complete Page Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-ring-video-doorbell-pro-the-ultimate-intelligent-home-security/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Ring Video Doorbell Pro - The Ultimate Intelligent Home Security</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-galaxy-ford-f150-rc-truck-evaluation-top-choice-in-the-rc-monster-trucks-market/"><u>In-Depth Galaxy Ford F150 RC Truck Evaluation – Top Choice in the RC Monster Trucks Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-review-of-samsung-galaxy-watch-3-classic-aesthetics-upgraded-for-todays-tech-enthusiasts/"><u>In-Depth Review of Samsung Galaxy Watch 3: Classic Aesthetics Upgraded for Today's Tech Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-tutorial-on-executing-high-quality-prints-via-photoshop/"><u>In-Depth Tutorial on Executing High-Quality Prints via Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/leading-edge-data-center-solutions-exploring-the-premier-rack-systems-of-2024/"><u>Leading Edge Data Center Solutions: Exploring the Premier Rack Systems of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/lenovos-breakthrough-thinkpad-x1-fold-assessing-its-revolutionary-design-and-functionality/"><u>Lenovo's Breakthrough ThinkPad X1 Fold: Assessing Its Revolutionary Design and Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/overcoming-the-mingwm10dll-not-found-dilemma-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Overcoming the 'Mingwm10.dll Not Found' Dilemma: A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for the full product review.</em></p><p> Luna is a game streaming service from Amazon that’s designed to compete with similar offerings like Microsoft’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5077716" >Game Pass Ultimate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s subscription-based, with no need to purchase games, so it shares more in common with Game Pass Ultimate. The optional controller takes a cue from Stadia, with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430" >Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> based connection that helps reduce latency. This could be the future of gaming, but with poor mobile support, a thin library, and no<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at launch, it isn’t there quite yet.</p><p> While Luna is still in beta, I was able to secure a subscription and controller and put the service to the test. I used it with my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-4172274" >Fire TV Cube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Insignia Fire TV Edition, Chrome and Safari browsers, and even my Pixel 3 toward the end when Amazon added support for additional Android phones. During my time with the service, I tested things like latency and lag, overall playability, the performance and feel of the controller, and the depth and breadth of the streaming library.</p><p> Luna is an impressive service with what seems like solid underlying tech right out of the gate. The biggest questions seem to be how and when Amazon will go about filling holes in the library, how well the service will work when they eventually roll out 4K streaming, and whether we’ll see better Android support in the future.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Controls-Decent-enough-app-and-a-nearly-flawless-controller"><a href="#Design-and-Controls-Decent-enough-app-and-a-nearly-flawless-controller" class="headerlink" title="Design and Controls: Decent enough app and a nearly flawless controller"></a>Design and Controls: Decent enough app and a nearly flawless controller</h2><p> Luna isn’t a traditional game console, so there isn’t much design to speak of in terms of hardware. The two important elements here are the Luna app, which operates as an Android app on Fire TV and a web app in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-chrome-4687647" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-safari-4173608" >Safari <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and the controller that’s technically optional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/c10USyUEVgaFrdeWRUBgX6MNpOQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Luna_05-7314cf2ae25a4f428d93f40cc56fb5d1.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Luna"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> The Luna app, both the Fire TV version and the web app version, is well-designed enough, without a whole lot to really stand out or impress. It functions as a basic interface to access all of the games that the service offers, including a Home screen that highlights games in various categories, a Library screen that lists every available game, and a Playlist page that provides easy access to games you have specifically chosen to place there.</p><p> The app is snappy and responsive in all of the forms I tested, allowing you to drill down to the game you want, launch it, and start playing with a minimum of time and effort. One touch that you may or may not appreciate is that individual game pages include links to current streams of that specific game on Amazon-owned<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-twitch-4143337" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In addition to the standard slate of trailers and screenshots, these streams may help you decide whether or not you actually want to devote time to playing a game that you’re on the fence about.</p><p> The controller is similarly unassuming, and Amazon clearly isn’t trying to rock the boat there. It’s extremely similar in profile to an Xbox One controller, right down to the positioning of the offset analog sticks. This configuration has long been my favorite, with the Sony-style side-by-side analogs feeling cramped, so the Luna controller feels instinctually good in my hands. If you’re a fan of the Xbox One controller, you’ll likely feel the same. If you don’t like the Xbox-style design for whatever reason, then you may at least appreciate the fact that the build quality of the controller feels quite solid, and it’s very snappy and responsive in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jNDwaMGOVuF5UIISPsmdb5uQdGU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Luna_04-985a4419a93945d2879b09d61fafae5a.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Luna"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> In addition to the offset analog sticks, the Luna controller also features a fairly standard array of buttons. A somewhat mushy directional pad sits below the left analog stick, and four familiar face buttons sit above the right stick. The triggers are fairly shallow but feel responsive, and shoulder buttons are easily accessed without moving your fingers off the triggers. In addition to the standard array, the Luna controller also includes a microphone button to access Alexa.</p><p> Like the Stadia controller, the Luna controller supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Bluetooth is used primarily while setting up the controller, although you can also use it to connect directly to your computer with the aid of a custom driver. The built-in Wi-Fi allows the controller to connect directly to the Luna servers, without using your computer as a middle-man. That’s the same trick Google Stadia uses to minimize lag when playing fast-paced games, and it works just as well here as it does there.</p><p> The Luna controller has quickly become one of my favorite alternatives to the Xbox One or Xbox Series X&#x2F;S controller.</p><p> In terms of ports, the Luna controller includes a USB-C port for charging and connectivity and a 3.5mm port for plugging in your favorite set of headphones or earbuds. At the back, you’ll find a removable battery cover, as the controller is powered by two AA batteries.</p><p> Overall, the Luna controller has quickly become one of my favorite alternatives to the Xbox One or Xbox Series X&#x2F;S controller; the only real issues being the mushy d-pad and the texture of the analog sticks. I ended up snapping on some performance thumb grips, which worked great.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Quick and easy"></a>Setup Process: Quick and easy</h2><p> Luna is just about as easy to use as a gaming service can be. To use Luna, there’s zero setup involved. If you’re playing on Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android, you can just connect a compatible controller, navigate to the Luna website, and start playing. The Fire TV app is similarly easy to get up and running.</p><p> If you’re using the optional Luna controller, there is a bit of additional setup to work through. You can choose to have your controller automatically linked to your Amazon account when you buy it, which simplifies setup a bit, but it’s a fairly straightforward process either way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6427gP-MSnqe4st8hfuI-7yxlos=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Luna_03-f12a92bc606e43caa77b445a2fdcf1c1.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Luna"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> If you do opt to link your controller to your Amazon account when you buy it, and you already own other Amazon devices like<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that are connected to your Wi-Fi connection, then you can take advantage of Amazon’s Wi-Fi simple setup that shaves some time off the setup process. Otherwise, you just use the Luna controller app on your Android or iPhone to hook the controller up to Wi-Fi.</p><p> After the initial setup process, your Luna controller is ready to go regardless of platform. Power on the controller, launch the Luna app or website, and everything automatically connects without any additional work or input.</p><h2 id="Performance-Impressive-game-streaming-but-no-4K"><a href="#Performance-Impressive-game-streaming-but-no-4K" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Impressive game streaming, but no 4K"></a>Performance: Impressive game streaming, but no 4K</h2><p> I tested Luna with the optional Wi-Fi Luna controller and a wired Xbox Series X&#x2F;S controller on my Windows laptop and with the Luna controller on my Fire TV Cube,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-air-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092793" >M1 MacBook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Pixel 3 phone, and Fire TV Edition Insignia television. Each of these devices was connected to a 1GB cable internet connection from Mediacom via my Eero mesh 5GHz Wi-Fi network.</p><p> Luna offers an impressive streaming experience that’s on par with what I’ve seen from Google and Microsoft.</p><p> So while I don’t live anywhere near a metropolitan area, and there aren’t any Amazon servers anywhere near my physical location, it is important to note that I have a strong, fast internet connection, and my experience with Luna reflects that.</p><p> Luna offers an impressive streaming experience that’s on par with what I’ve seen from Google and Microsoft. Initial loading time is essentially nonexistent, and I experienced very little lag. The Wi-Fi controller reduces latency by about 17 to 30 milliseconds according to Amazon. But I actually found the service to be quite playable even with an Xbox Series X&#x2F;S controller. If your internet connection is slower though, that 30-millisecond reduction could theoretically make a huge difference.</p><p> I played dozens of other games on the service, including the deceptively addictive Lumines, nostalgia bombs like Castlevania Collection and R-Type Dimensions, cute RPG Monster Boy, and a bunch of others, and they all played well.</p><p> The first game I loaded up on the service was Sonic Mania Plus, as it’s a pretty fast-paced game, and I felt like it would give me a good baseline of what to expect. Playing with the Luna controller, I found the controls to be snappy and responsive without a hint of lag. I know there physically has to be some amount of lag, but whatever latency is introduced by the travel time to and from Amazon’s servers was consistently small enough that I wasn’t able to perceive it.</p><p> I played dozens of other games on the service, including the deceptively addictive Lumines, nostalgia bombs like Castlevania Collection and R-Type Dimensions, cute RPG Monster Boy, and a bunch of others, and they all played well. I did experience brief hiccups from time to time, with Luna warning of ‘network issues’ despite my network and internet connection being rock-solid; that sort of intermittent problem is almost guaranteed just by the fickle nature of the internet itself.</p><p> While the intermittent so-called network issues could end up proving a massive headache in competitive online games, they were few enough, and far enough between, that my own gaming experience was still positive when taken as a whole.</p><p> If you have a slow internet connection or suffer from poor connectivity, then it’s likely that the brief issues I experienced could be amplified to an unacceptable point. If you have a decent connection, live closer to a major metropolitan area than I do, and have more than 10Mbps of downstream bandwidth available, the service should work just fine.</p><h2 id="Software-Dozens-of-games-but-the-library-is-a-bit-thin-with-a-lot-of-holes"><a href="#Software-Dozens-of-games-but-the-library-is-a-bit-thin-with-a-lot-of-holes" class="headerlink" title="Software: Dozens of games, but the library is a bit thin with a lot of holes"></a>Software: Dozens of games, but the library is a bit thin with a lot of holes</h2><p> Luna’s biggest issue, and its biggest question mark going forward, is its streaming library. Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft’s book in that they’re trying to function as a Netflix of game streaming, but Amazon just doesn’t have the same deep library as Microsoft.</p><p> While Amazon did manage to cobble together a fairly impressive assortment of games for the initial launch, a lot of the best games on the platform are locked behind an add-on subscription to the Ubisoft+ channel. If you want to play games like Far Cry 5,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-review-an-epic-viking-adventure-across-the-medieval-world-5086782" >Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to pony up for the additional subscription.</p><p> Amazon is taking a page from Microsoft’s book in that they’re trying to function as a Netflix of game streaming, but Amazon just doesn’t have the same deep library as Microsoft.</p><p> During the beta period, the basic Luna subscription gets you access to 70 games, with an additional two dozen games locked behind the Ubisoft+ subscription. The 70 games included with the basic subscription offer a ton of entertainment value, but most genres are woefully underrepresented, and others are missing altogether. For example, fans of fighting games won’t find anything to rally behind here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NBB1N6qtwbtdjrUgwr1YaBaTuBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon_Luna_02-37837bf860d244d3ab11ff01f37c609c-db472e204ada4ccca88e7510eacfae34.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Luna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115935/19272" target="_top" id="2115935">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115935" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115935/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> For some reason, the fighting category is populated by titles like the rogue-like shooter Everspace and the co-op brawler River City Girls. No actual fighting games, though. The horror category was empty until Amazon scored Resident Evil 7 Gold Edition and also saddled gorefest pixel art platformer Valfaris with the horror tag.</p><p> It’s clear that Amazon is working to bring a nice mix of games to the service, but the depth and breadth of the titles you can access with a basic subscription remain the biggest question as Luna moves through beta and toward general launch.</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-fee-reflects-the-thin-library"><a href="#Price-Affordable-fee-reflects-the-thin-library" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable fee reflects the thin library"></a>Price: Affordable fee reflects the thin library</h2><p> Luna comes with a price tag of $4.95 per month during the beta period, with the insinuation that it will increase later on. It’s uncertain as to whether or not the price will actually go up, but right now it’s a pretty good deal. The only real caveat is that the attractive price tag is balanced by a somewhat thin library. Go ahead and check the library before you sign up. If you see more than a handful of games you’re interested in, then Luna is absolutely worth the price of admission.</p><p> The Luna controller has a heftier price tag of $50, but that’s actually pretty reasonable if you compare it to other wireless controllers. It’s cheaper than a lot of the other options, and you can use it via Wi-Fi with Luna, or via Bluetooth or USB-C to play non-Luna games on your PC. All in all, it’s a good controller that’s priced competitively.</p><h2 id="Amazon-Luna-vs-Microsoft-Game-Pass-Ultimate"><a href="#Amazon-Luna-vs-Microsoft-Game-Pass-Ultimate" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Luna vs. Microsoft Game Pass Ultimate"></a>Amazon Luna vs. Microsoft Game Pass Ultimate</h2><p> Microsoft Game Pass Ultimate, which includes the xCloud streaming service, is the closest analog to Luna. They’re both monthly subscription services, and they both use a Netflix model where you can stream whatever you want, however much you want, whenever you want, without needing to actually buy the games.</p><p> In terms of price, Luna has the advantage over Game Pass Ultimate. Luna only costs $4.95 per month during the beta period, while Game Pass Ultimate costs $15 per month. Luna also lets you play in more locations, with support for Windows, macOS, iOS, and some Android phones via web browser and Fire TV via app. Game Pass only lets you stream via<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-smartphones-577403" >Android phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tablets, although they will likely support more platforms in the future.</p><p> In terms of games, Game Pass has the edge. You get access to over 100 games, compared to 75 in the base Luna subscription. You can also download and play the games on your PC or Xbox console with Game Pass, and all Xbox Game Studio games are added to the service the same day they are released.</p><p> If you’re a PC gamer or own an Xbox, Game Pass Ultimate is a pretty great deal. Luna is far more affordable though, making it the better choice if you don’t own a gaming rig.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >The Best Gaming Consoles of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A solid game streaming service.</strong></p><p> Amazon Luna is an impressive game streaming service that works surprisingly well whether or not you buy the optional controller. It isn’t perfect, and you’re likely to experience hiccups here and there, but it’s an extremely affordable way to experience dozens of games, many of which would otherwise require an expensive gaming PC or console, without any kind of initial investment. The future of the service remains uncertain, and the precedent of locking Ubisoft games behind an expensive additional paywall isn’t a great sign, but Amazon has a chance to make a real splash in the gaming world with Luna.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115942/19272" target="_top" id="2115942">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115942" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115942/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-series-x-or-s-controller-review-5113227" >Xbox Series X|S Controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-dualsense-wireless-controller-review-feel-the-quality-5101639" >Sony DualSense Wireless Controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >Xbox One Elite Controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Luna</li><li>Product Brand  Amazon</li><li>UPC  0841667153223</li><li>Price  $5.99</li><li>Release Date  September 2020</li><li>Weight  8.2 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.15 x 4.23 x 2.3 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Warranty  1 year limited</li><li>Platforms  Fire TV Stick (2nd gen., 4k), Fire Stick Lite, Fire TV Cube (2nd gen.), Toshiba and Insignia Fire TV, Android (certain Pixel, Galaxy, and OnePlus phones), PC (via web browser)</li><li>Ports  USB-C, 3.5mm audio (controller)</li><li>Peripherals  Luna controller (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) is optional</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-igtv-video-submission-made-simple-for-2024/"><u>[New] IGTV Video Submission Made Simple for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-earnings-expansion-on-glamour-channels/"><u>[New] In 2024, Earnings Expansion on Glamour Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-transform-photos-with-expert-color-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Transform Photos with Expert Color Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/a-checklist-important-considerations-when-shopping-for-vr-technology/"><u>A Checklist: Important Considerations When Shopping for VR Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/best-karaoke-options-across-the-us-quality-entertainment-under-150-reviewed/"><u>Best Karaoke Options Across the US – Quality Entertainment Under $150 Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-film-logging-how-to-use-devices-like-pros/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Film Logging How to Use Devices Like Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-teleport-your-gps-location-on-motorola-edge-40-neo-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Teleport Your GPS Location On Motorola Edge 40 Neo?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Curved TVs haven’t caught on in a big way, given that the vast majority of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >4K HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sets sold today are still flat. Still, curved-screen sets are out there if you want something a little different, or perhaps something that provides a supposedly more immersive viewing experience. These days, Samsung is really the only brand-name manufacturer still pumping out new curved sets in North America, with a range of sizes and prices available.</p><p> Samsung’s 55-inch RU7300 Curved 4K HDR Smart TV is on the lower end of that price scale, with an MSRP of $550, but seen on sale for less than $500. It’s a sharp-looking set, given the high-resolution 4K image, and the curved design is appealing—although it comes with the same set of limitations and complications as any curved TV screen.</p><p> Lacking brightness holds it back a bit, minimizing the effect of HDR, but this is still a pretty nice set for the price, assuming that you’re fixated on a curved screen. I tested Samsung’s RU7300 for more than 80 hours across streaming media, video games, movies, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LtRcWBwD090kcd6bXSRbOUiTiLA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_CurvedTVs_RU7300_02-2035b246c96446388cc49504b68842ba.jpg"                      alt="Samsung 55-inch RU7300"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Design-An-appealing-arc"><a href="#Design-An-appealing-arc" class="headerlink" title="Design: An appealing arc"></a><strong>Design: An appealing arc</strong></h2><p> The Samsung 55-inch RU7300 has a bit more visual pop than your average<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >large-screen 4K HDR set <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> because it is physically popping out towards you on the right and left sides, unlike a standard flat television. It’s a subtle curve overall, but enough to be just noticeable—especially from the sides. That might make it an awkward fit for wall mounting, but it has a distinctive edge that’s unlike nearly every other TV you’ll find in stores.</p><p> Curves aside, Samsung went pretty minimal on the front of the set, with a black plastic frame that’s nearly uniform around the screen—but slightly thicker on the bottom, with a tiny Samsung logo sitting on a small metallic accent at the center. The two legs strike a wide stance on either end, and aren’t especially chunky.</p><p> Meanwhile, the back of the TV has a series of uneven ridged horizontal stripes that are attractive. You’ll find the array of ports here, split between two panels. There are three HDMI ports, two USB ports, an optical audio out, an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and hybrid component&#x2F;AV cables for older devices. That should be plenty for your various devices, although some TVs around this price point pack in another<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The included remote control is compact, but filled with all of the buttons you’ll need to navigate menus, tap in channel numbers, and reach your favorite streaming services. It has dedicated buttons for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video right on the remote, plus there are four programmable, color-coded A-D buttons for favorite channels. The TV itself also has a small control nub underneath the Samsung logo, but it’s difficult to feel around for and use.</p><p> Low input lag means that games feel responsive, making this set well-suited for gaming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115935/19272" target="_top" id="2115935">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115935" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115935/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Legs-or-wall"><a href="#Setup-Process-Legs-or-wall" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Legs or wall"></a><strong>Setup Process: Legs or wall</strong></h2><p> If you’re setting the Samsung RU7300 up on a stand or table, then you’ll need to install the legs. That is extremely straightforward: each is designated for a certain side and simply requires popping in and tightening a couple of screws. Meanwhile, if you opt for wall-mounting, you’ll need a standard VESA 200x200 mount—however, you may need longer screws. The screws on my existing wall mount (for a flat-screen TV) weren’t long enough, so I had to order specialized ones.</p><p> Initial software setup can take a few minutes, as you’ll be prompted to log into a Wi-Fi network if you don’t have an Ethernet cable plugged into an active connection, and you may have to download updates to Samsung’s built-in interface. It was a pretty quick process for me.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crisp-but-could-be-bolder"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crisp-but-could-be-bolder" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crisp, but could be bolder"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crisp, but could be bolder</strong></h2><p> At 3840x2160 (4K Ultra HD) resolution, Samsung’s RU7300 has sharpness covered, delivering crisply detailed visuals across the board. Native 4K media looks fantastic, as expected, and lower-resolution media scales up pretty smoothly. And low input lag means that games feel responsive, making this set well-suited for gaming.</p><p> Samsung advertises HDR support here, but it doesn’t pack quite the same punch as on some other TVs in this price range. This curved set just doesn’t get immensely bright, so it’s difficult to see quite as much variance in the dynamic range. Watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 4K, it’s still inherently vibrant due to the source material, but lacks the extra edge in dynamism and contrast, and even looks a bit dim at times. The image quality isn’t bad in any way, but it doesn’t hit quite the peaks that I’d expected.</p><p> As for the curved design, it’s difficult to really see the advantages beyond wanting something a bit different from the pack. Whether playing games or watching movies or TV shows, I didn’t feel like the picture was any more immersive due to the slight arc of the display. But the curved screen does bring some notable downsides, such as ambient light more clearly reflecting off of the curves, and viewing angles suffering at wider angles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GaFmEEESPt4pM-0PAQ3JifVZPOw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Samsung_CurvedTVs_RU7300_03-e3e60b2553d84a6cb6a03c52a94073a0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung 55-inch RU7300"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136625/26400" target="_top" id="2136625">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136625" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136625/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Totally-solid-sound"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Totally-solid-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Totally solid sound"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Totally solid sound</strong></h2><p> The Samsung 55-inch RU7300 has a pair of stereo speakers with a total output of 20W, and they’ll get the job done for everyday viewing of streaming shows and movies, and playing games. Playback is clear and full, although it’s not heavy on bass—and unlike a lot of other modestly-priced televisions, I wasn’t immediately itching for a soundbar. You’ll see an improvement from external speakers, certainly, but it doesn’t feel as necessary here.</p><h2 id="Software-Clean-but-incomplete"><a href="#Software-Clean-but-incomplete" class="headerlink" title="Software: Clean, but incomplete"></a><strong>Software: Clean, but incomplete</strong></h2><p> Samsung’s own<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-tizen-4580383" >Tizen OS-based <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Smart Hub interface is used on this curved smart TV, providing easy access to streaming video apps and settings. Most of the heavy hitters are here, either already installed or available via the built-in app marketplace, including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and even<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-tv-1994193" >Apple TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There are some omissions, however: both Twitch and Bravo were missing in action when I searched for them. Samsung also offers a number of free streaming channels in partnership with Pluto TV, in case you miss the sensation of flipping channels for something to watch.</p><p> Even with some popular apps missing, the interface is very clean and easy to use, taking up only a small chunk of space at the bottom of your screen when hunting for your next app so you can still see what you were already watching or playing. Sponsored ads for streaming video channels and newly-released movies might be annoying to some users, however.</p><p> Native 4K media looks fantastic, as expected, and lower-resolution media scales up pretty smoothly.</p><h2 id="Price-Curves-cost-extra"><a href="#Price-Curves-cost-extra" class="headerlink" title="Price: Curves cost extra"></a><strong>Price: Curves cost extra</strong></h2><p> There aren’t many curved televisions currently on the market, so it’s difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison. However, looking at other mid-range 4K HDR Smart TVs with flat screens, you can find numerous models for less cash than the $550 asking price of the RU7300. Still, the RU7300 has been selling for around $480 as of this writing, which is easier to stomach if you’re set on a curved screen.</p><h2 id="Samsung-55-inch-RU7300-Curved-TV-vs-Vizio-M-Series-Quantum-50-inch-TV"><a href="#Samsung-55-inch-RU7300-Curved-TV-vs-Vizio-M-Series-Quantum-50-inch-TV" class="headerlink" title="Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved TV vs. Vizio M-Series Quantum 50-inch TV"></a><strong>Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved TV vs. Vizio M-Series Quantum 50-inch TV</strong></h2><p> Here’s one example of how you can save a fair amount of cash by skipping the curved screen—and get a better TV in the process. Vizio’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/vizio-m-series-quantum-50-inch-4k-smart-tv-m507-g1-review-4842757" >M-Series Quantum 50-inch 4K HDR TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/vizio-50-class-led-m-series-quantum-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr/6345462.p?skuId=6345462" >Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a little smaller in size, sure, but not significantly so. Better yet, it delivers a brighter and more vibrant picture, with local dimming zones boosting the black levels.</p><p> They’re not significantly far apart in overall quality, but with the Vizio set priced at $400 and seen on sale for less, it shows that lower-priced sets can actually be an upgrade over this curved option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-48-inch-tvs-4138374" >Hisense 50H8F Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The curve isn’t essential, but it’s a solid mid-range TV if you can find it on sale.</strong></p><p> If you’re sold on a curved screen, whether it’s due to the distinctive nature or purported added level of immersiveness, then the Samsung 55-inch RU7300 Curved 4K HDR Smart TV is a pretty good mid-range choice. It’s more expensive than similarly-specced flat 4K HDR sets, but that’s the price you’ll pay for a significant niche feature. Samsung’s curved set comes up a little short on brightness, which impacts the quality of the HDR experience, but otherwise provides a nice-looking picture, responsive inputs, and a slick-looking interface.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129740/7443" target="_top" id="2129740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  UN55RU7300FXZA 55-Inch 4KUHD 7 Series</li><li>Product Brand  Samsung</li><li>Price  $500.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2019</li><li>Product Dimensions  48.7 x 28.1 x 4.1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Resolution  3840x2160</li><li>HDR  Yes</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, 2x USB, Component Video, Optical, Coaxial, Ethernet, A&#x2F;V</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-itel-p40plus-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock from your Itel P40+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/elite-selection-of-iphone-malware-defenders-discover-the-best-antivirus-options/"><u>Elite Selection of iPhone Malware Defenders: Discover the Best Antivirus Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-makeblock-mbot-assembling-adventure-constructing-and-programming-for-a-rewarding-robotic-experience/"><u>Exploring the Makeblock mBot Assembling Adventure: Constructing and Programming for a Rewarding Robotic Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-cast-realme-narzo-60x-5g-to-computer-for-iphone-and-android-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Cast Realme Narzo 60x 5G to Computer for iPhone and Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-catch-or-beat-sleeping-snorlax-on-pokemon-go-for-zte-blade-a73-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Catch or Beat Sleeping Snorlax on Pokemon Go For ZTE Blade A73 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/innovative-leaders-in-hexadrones-10/"><u>Innovative Leaders in HexaDrones - 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/leading-brands-offering-the-best-steadicams-for-dslr-users/"><u>Leading Brands Offering the Best Steadicams for DSLR Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/mastery-in-converting-classic-vhs-into-high-quality-pictures/"><u>Mastery in Converting Classic VHS Into High-Quality Pictures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/rugged-protection-meets-elegance-a-detailed-review-of-urban-armor-gears-macbook-pro-case/"><u>Rugged Protection Meets Elegance: A Detailed Review of Urban Armor Gear’s MacBook Pro Case</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/the-complete-guide-to-lava-blaze-2-5g-frp-bypass-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/"><u>The Complete Guide to Lava Blaze 2 5G FRP Bypass Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/utilize-picture-in-picture-mode-efficiently-in-safari/"><u>Utilize Picture In Picture Mode Efficiently in Safari</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches bring a bounty of functionality to the table—and right to your wrist. But these devices also tend to cast a wider net that includes fitness tracking among many other tools like listening to music or responding to email. If focusing on workouts and general wellness is your priority, you may be interested in scaling back from a full-blown<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a full-time fitness tracker like the Samsung Galaxy Fit.</p><p> This new addition to the Samsung wearable lineup carries over many of the hallmarks of smartwatches offered by the brand, but in a much slimmer profile and a more targeted and accurate focus on fitness.</p><p> We tested the Samsung Galaxy Fit on its ability to track workouts and how comfortable it is as a 24&#x2F;7 accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Tf5FJJb3h1iBWaZIkx-ZF7NeOTg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-6-b9990e3655e34e2ca712150225748ab6.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated"><a href="#Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated" class="headerlink" title="Design: Functional and slightly elevated"></a><strong>Design: Functional and slightly elevated</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit is a fitness-oriented device, and the design reflects this. It’s clean, minimal, and straightforward. Not only is this wearable extremely lightweight at only 0.81 ounces, but it’s also quite slim, which gives it a bracelet-like appearance.</p><p> There’s only one button to interact with, and it’s located on the left side of the watch and is responsive and straightforward to use. The strap is made of durable rubber and includes plenty of notches for a close fit. While the band is more focused on ruggedness and skews more toward the typical fitness watch aesthetic, the screen gives the device a more refined appearance.</p><p> The face is long and narrow and features a crisp, full-color AMOLED 120 x 240 display. This bright display is pleasing to the eye, but the scroll interaction is somewhat awkward given the size of the screen. A very light touch is necessary, and even then, it may take some time to get used to scrolling on such a narrow surface area.</p><p> We found the quick-access menu particularly difficult to maneuver. A swipe down from the top of the screen reveals it, but swiping to the right to toggle through all the options often just closed the menu altogether.</p><p> While this watch is diminutive in size, it can withstand the wear and tear that comes with biking, swimming, and other activities. The device as a whole is rugged and heavy-duty enough to withstand 50 meters of water as well as a drop or two, according to the MIL-STD-810G durability rating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uFwssrqnoTWtrPSlF6y16TFjA5A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-2-2e9d9cba7ec342918320509e630b0f09.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point"><a href="#Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Speedy and to the point"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Speedy and to the point</strong></h2><p> Other than the watch itself, the only other equipment is a wireless charging dock. Charging to 100 percent is recommended at setup, and it took us about 40 minutes for the device to charge in full from about 70 percent charged out of the box.</p><p> After that, we downloaded the compatible app for the device, called Galaxy Fit. We were able to pair the device in just a few seconds. We also had to download the Samsung Health app in order to access our activity data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E_Ki7o6LChwW9AdtjDKL2L1lHjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-4-abd906dedc9c440188c23a5aabdfebe0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Comfort-Almost-undetectable"><a href="#Comfort-Almost-undetectable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Almost undetectable"></a><strong>Comfort: Almost undetectable</strong></h2><p> Like the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4174640" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , this device also features a tucked-in strap. The difference is that there’s a little pin with a round head instead of the straight pin that most watch buckles have. This detail makes for an extremely close fit that verges on almost too close.</p><p> The combination of such a close fit and little surface area made it a somewhat awkward to put on and take off the device—it was easier to ask for a second pair of hands to help nudge the strap out from underneath the band than wrestle with it alone.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, it was generally undetectable for most of the day, including while sleeping. When we did notice it, it was because it felt too snug, which was often the case by the end of day. Adjusting the fit for a looser feel left gapping in the band.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, its generally undetectable for most of the day—including while sleeping.</p><p> A little more surface area on the band and additional notches could be helpful for a more middle-of-the-line fit—what felt fine in the morning often felt way too tight by the end of the day.</p><p> So while it was mostly comfortable for general wear and during exercise activities, we found that the fit suffered from being either too tight or too loose because the adjustments weren’t incremental enough. It was hard to find a just-right middle ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRdpyMKwwNLE2m_Dnn2o9thnpQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-3-40a8d98ca4a04e7c9b5b18531df43e6f.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2114263/17093" target="_top" id="2114263">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2114263" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2114263/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy"><a href="#Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Performance: High marks for accuracy"></a><strong>Performance: High marks for accuracy</strong></h2><p> Since fitness tracking is really the name of the game for this device, we had high hopes that it would perform well. We weren’t disappointed by what we found. We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> On a walk, steps logged were in line with a Garmin watch we use to track activity, and so was running. The running data was particularly impressive to see stacked up against the running-focused Garmin watch. Even without initiating a run workout, mileage, time elapsed, pace, and cadence were all within very close range. The Garmin edged out the Galaxy Fit with heart rate and cadence details throughout the run instead of just an overall summary. But all in all, the accuracy was really quite spot on.</p><p> We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> Samsung says that swimming is automatically detected by the watch and water lock mode will initiate on its own, and we found that to be spot on when we took this watch along for laps in the pool. The results compiled in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072" >Samsung Health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app after the workout were also surprisingly detailed. We were able to see the strokes we’d performed and our corresponding pace, our stroke rate, overall distance covered, and something called SWOLF, which is a way to measure stroke efficiency.</p><p> One downside we noticed is that the Fit did not capture mileage for cycling workouts. While it did accurately and automatically track the time elapsed, there was little detail beyond that. The only way to track miles, pace, and speed was to launch a cycling workout through the Samsung Health app.</p><p> All activity data, including information on sleep quality and patterns, is laid out clearly in the supplementary Samsung Health app, which is particularly useful for viewing a week’s worth of activity data. It’s really the only way to see beyond the most recent activity or two, which is all the watch will show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/APk5ikkGQieSTN39gBAQ6rf6H9E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-5-5ff5a7cfa0c34594b8d74bbb224e9800.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115918/19272" target="_top" id="2115918">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115918" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115918/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use"><a href="#Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Good for a full week of use"></a><strong>Battery: Good for a full week of use</strong></h2><p> Samsung says this watch is good for up to seven to eight days with regular activity and use, and up to eleven days with minimal use. We found that this watch lasted on the initial charge for a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitness-trackers-with-the-best-battery-life-4077272" >eight days <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lined up with the manufacturer claims. It’s hard to say how the battery life would stack up to multiple workouts in a day—we typically only did one a day over the course of a week, but our experience with the device supports the strong battery life claims.</p><p> When we did have to charge the device again, we found that process to be speedy: it took only two hours to recharge in full.</p><h2 id="Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app"><a href="#Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app"></a><strong>Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app</strong></h2><p> Unlike other Samsung smartwatches, the Samsung Galaxy Fit is built on a FreeRTOS (real time operation software) platform. This OS relies heavily on the companion smartphone app and the Samsung Health app for a well-rounded experience.</p><p> Most of the settings for notifications and even choosing quick, pre-written responses to texts can be set up through the mobile app. You can also choose watch faces to personalize the style of your Galaxy Fit—there’s a specific screen inside the app that details all the design options and allows you to change the look whenever you want.</p><p> In addition to controlling the watch settings easily from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Samsung Health app is the other go-to resource. Here you can view all the information captured by the activity tracker, including fitness, sleep, and even stress levels. You can also take this a step further by using the app to monitor calories, weight, and water intake.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136618/26400" target="_top" id="2136618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136618/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Great-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Great-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Great for what you get</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit retails for $99.99, which makes it a strong competitor in the fitness tracker market. Similarly-priced devices from the Fitbit brand offer an equivalent bundle of all-day activity tracking and general wellness features but lack the vibrant display of the Galaxy Fit.</p><p> There are cheaper options out there, too, like the Garmin vívofit 4, which sells for between $60 and $80. But it lacks a heart rate monitor or the smart capabilities of the Fit, like canned text-messaging responses and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail. For the activity tracking and smart device functionality, the Fit is a fair price and maybe even a bargain for some.</p><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR"></a><strong>Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR is a close competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Fit. Both are priced at just below $100 and have many of the same wellness and activity tracking features. Both are water resistant up to 50 meters, track active and resting heart rate, feature sport profiles, log sleeping activity, and integrate various types of notifications.</p><p> But the Galaxy Fit offers wireless charging and a full-color display, while the Fitbit Inspire HR comes with a charging cable and sports a grayscale<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display. The Fitbit also only has a five-day battery life versus the maximum eleven-day battery life on the Fit. But the FitBit Inspire HR also comes with some tools that the Fit lacks, like a timer and stopwatch and menstrual tracking.</p><p> Not quite sure if a fitness tracker or smartwatch is for you? Check out our round-ups of the best smartwatches, the best smartwatches for women, and the best fitness trackers.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An all-around winner for fitness-minded shoppers.</strong></p><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit is an appealing option for those who want a bit of smartwatch functionality and a heavy emphasis on exercise monitoring—without shelling out too much money. The fit, ironically, may be the largest issue. But if you’re able to find the right size, this may be everything you want in a fitness tracker.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-review-4766873" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitbit-versa-review-4769748" >Fitbit Versa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-watch-series-4-review-4769752" >Apple Watch Series 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Galaxy Fit</li><li>Product Brand  Samsung</li><li>MPN  SM-R370NZKAZAR</li><li>Price  $99.99</li><li>Weight  0.81 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.78 x 0.72 x 0.45 in.</li><li>Battery Life  About 8 days</li><li>Compatibility  Samsung, Android 5.0+, iPhone 7+, iOS 10+</li><li>Water Resistance  Up to 50 meters</li><li>Cables  Wireless charging</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth 5.0 (LE only)</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/pokemon-shining-pearl-unlocking-the-secrets-to-an-unforgettable-and-fun-playthrough/"><u>'Pokemon Shining Pearl': Unlocking the Secrets to an Unforgettable and Fun Playthrough</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-decoding-the-top-5-transformative-social-updates/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Decoding the Top 5 Transformative Social Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-facebooks-approach-for-automatic-youtube-video-playback/"><u>[Updated] Facebook's Approach for Automatic YouTube Video Playback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/5-techniques-for-capturing-win10-games-for-2024/"><u>5 Techniques for Capturing Win10 Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-vixia-camcorder-spotlight-the-r800/"><u>Budget-Friendly VIXIA Camcorder Spotlight: The R800</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/canon-powershot-g7-x-mark-ii-review-compact-but-powerful/"><u>Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II Review: Compact but Powerful</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/comprehensive-strategies-to-address-and-repair-haldll-failures-in-windows-xp/"><u>Comprehensive Strategies to Address and Repair 'hal.dll' Failures in Windows XP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/decoding-the-success-of-fallout-new-vegas-directors-cut-an-intriguing-tactical-rpg-experience/"><u>Decoding the Success of Fallout: New Vegas' Director’s Cut – An Intriguing Tactical RPG Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/hidden-gems-in-the-world-of-google-podcasts-for-2024/"><u>Hidden Gems in the World of Google Podcasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-poco-x5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Poco X5 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/inside-scoop-on-nhl-19-how-gamers-are-winning-on-digital-turf/"><u>Inside Scoop on NHL '19: How Gamers Are Winning on Digital Turf</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/navigating-the-future-with-lenovos-thinkpad-x1-fold-game-changing-but-not-without-setbacks/"><u>Navigating the Future with Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Fold: Game-Changing but Not Without Setbacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-stutter-and-fps-drop-problems-in-counter-strike-2-for-pc-gaming/"><u>Troubleshooting Stutter & FPS Drop Problems in Counter-Strike 2 for PC Gaming</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches are incredible devices, and the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is no exception. It’s remarkable how much advanced tech is crammed below the glass of this diminutive device. I ran it through its paces to see if it can stand out in a crowded and competitive niche.</p><h2 id="Design-Attractive-and-minimalistic"><a href="#Design-Attractive-and-minimalistic" class="headerlink" title="Design: Attractive and minimalistic"></a><strong>Design: Attractive and minimalistic</strong></h2><p> At first glance, you could be forgiven for not realizing that the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Its round, modern, minimalist design is attractive but subtle. The face of the watch is made of scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3, the case is built of rugged polymer, and the strap is silicone. This rugged construction comes with a waterproofing rating of 5 atmospheres (ATM), which means it’s rated down to 163 feet. However, it’s worth noting that this watch isn’t intended for diving use.</p><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music is operated using both the touch screen and a single button on the side. A short press of the button switches between the app currently in use and the watch face, while a long press brings up a circular menu with shortcuts to menus and apps. Most navigation is controlled via the touchscreen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M4iaS5RgiaubncJH8F-ZLVQQ8Po=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-2-a0cd2c48cc0d423d85a3dc1f7e677160.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Comfort-On-the-small-side"><a href="#Comfort-On-the-small-side" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: On the small side"></a><strong>Comfort: On the small side</strong></h2><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music is perfectly comfortable if you have small or medium-sized wrists, but the included band was a little small for my extra-large 9-inch wrists. Personally, I couldn’t stand to wear it all day long due to this sizing issue. In order to fully test the watch, I handed it off to a friend with smaller 7-inch wrists, who reported it was extremely comfortable.</p><p> The size of the watch itself is reasonably compact and comparable to larger traditional watches. It weighs only 39 grams, light enough to not feel like a burden.</p><p> The included band was a little small for my extra-large 9-inch wrists.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fairly-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fairly-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fairly straightforward"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fairly straightforward</strong></h2><p> Getting started with the Vivoactive 3 Music is reasonably easy, though it did take me some time after connecting to my phone to get through all the necessary permissions and connections it requires. There were updates to install, and I needed to create an account with Garmin. I also downloaded Spotify and connected the Vivoactive 3 to my wireless earbuds. Note that you need to connect to Wi-Fi to download music via Spotify or another app.</p><h2 id="Performance-Hit-and-miss"><a href="#Performance-Hit-and-miss" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Hit and miss"></a><strong>Performance: Hit and miss</strong></h2><p> When I started using the Vivoactive 3 Music, I found the heart rate monitor to be less than reliable. Sometimes it reported over a hundred BPM while I was sitting on the couch. However, it appears my large wrists are the culprit here, as it reported heart rate more accurately when used by other people with smaller wrists.</p><p> The information collected by the watch can all be found in granular detail in the Garmin Connect app on your phone. The watch has special settings for a wide variety of activities from walking to swimming. It’s quite accurate at distance tracking, step counts, and sleep tracking.</p><p> The 1.2-inch screen has an acceptable resolution of 240 x 240 pixels. It looks fine, and I never had issues with the quality of the image displayed, but it’s quite dim and difficult to see in bright conditions. The touchscreen interface is responsive, though a bit laggy, and it doesn’t always automatically brighten the display when you flip your wrist to check the time.</p><p>The touchscreen interface is responsive, though a bit laggy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770544">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770544">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770544%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770544/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Variable-duration"><a href="#Battery-Variable-duration" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Variable duration"></a><strong>Battery: Variable duration</strong></h2><p> How long the battery in the Vivoactive 3 Music lasts depends entirely on how it’s used. If you only use its smartwatch capabilities occasionally then it’s good for a week at a time. However, when I made use of GPS, music, and other power-intensive features, it would run out in less than a full day of use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NdBt6UHu7uQUfRZfJN5BzwIEad8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-3-18b432ab56ac4ef284ba74ffd1ec7f82.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137393/7443" target="_top" id="2137393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137393/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-Proprietary-ecosystem"><a href="#Software-Proprietary-ecosystem" class="headerlink" title="Software: Proprietary ecosystem"></a><strong>Software: Proprietary ecosystem</strong></h2><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music utilizes Garmin’s proprietary operating system and app store. I was impressed by the wide variety of apps available in the Garmin IQ store. There are numerous downloadable watch faces (I particularly loved one with a Star Trek theme), multiple music apps including Spotify and Amazon Music, maps, tools, and games.</p><p> Though the quality seems to vary, this range of apps opens up a world of customization. I can’t really recommend gaming on the Vivoactive 3 Music though—the screen is just too small, and it’s hard to control anything even as simple as Tetris. However, there are situations where having a simple game on your watch would be really desirable to pass the time, even if it’s hard to control. Keep in mind, though, that games and apps eat away at battery quickly when used actively and frequently.</p><p> You don’t need to lug your phone along with you to use many of the features of this watch.</p><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music also includes<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/most-popular-mobile-payment-apps-2373179" >contactless payment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through Garmin Pay, which supports a wide range of major cards and banks. It’s a cool feature and is especially desirable from a hygiene perspective as well as for ease and simplicity.</p><p> Of course, the standout feature of the Vivoactive 3 Music is that it can store and play music, which is all that separates the Vivoactive 3 from the Vivoactive 3 Music. It can store up to 500 songs, and I downloaded several albums via Spotify to listen to while out and about. The watch connects to wireless headphones via Bluetooth, which along with the built-in GPS and Wi-Fi means that in many cases you don’t need to lug your phone along with you to use many of the watch’s features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dALT4qb1vS9VNEvePqYoZlqXX0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-4-a84ac637f7034353bffd90856070a7d8.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983473">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983473">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983473%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983473/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-value"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable value"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable value</strong></h2><p> At its MSRP of $249 the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is acceptably priced for the features it packs in.

The Fossil Sport also has a more premium look and a scroll wheel, as well as three dedicated buttons for navigation.

However, I could never fully enjoy using it due to its less than the optimal interface and laggy operation. This might be a good option if you are already invested in Garmin’s products, but for me it’s hard to ignore the flaws.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music</li><li>Product Brand  Garmin</li><li>Price  $249.00</li><li>Weight  1.37 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.7 x 1.7 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Color  Granite Blue&#x2F;Rose Gold, Black&#x2F;Silver</li><li>Battery Life  up to 7 days</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Waterproofing  5 ATM</li><li>Wireless  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth</li><li>Display resolution  240 x 240 pixels</li><li>Display size  1.2”</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/3-effective-ways-to-unlock-icloud-account-without-password-on-apple-iphone-6-by-drfone-ios/"><u>3 Effective Ways to Unlock iCloud Account Without Password On Apple iPhone 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/a-full-review-for-itools-virtual-location-and-top-5-alternatives-for-apple-iphone-12-pro-maxipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Full Review for iTools Virtual Location and Top 5 Alternatives For Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max/iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-review-bigger-can-be-better/"><u>Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Review: Bigger Can Be Better</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/comprehensive-breakdown-sony-fdr-x1000v-complete-guide-for-2024/"><u>Comprehensive Breakdown Sony FDR-X1000V Complete Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-tecno-phantom-v-flip-location-on-twitter-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change your Tecno Phantom V Flip Location on Twitter | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-iphone-editing-magic-shorter-smaller-videos/"><u>In 2024, Unlock iPhone Editing Magic Shorter, Smaller Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-asus-zephyrus-g14-uncompromising-performance-for-gamers/"><u>In-Depth Look at the ASUS Zephyrus G14 - Uncompromising Performance for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/iphone-x-a-complete-animoji-guide-for-proficient-users-for-2024/"><u>IPhone X A Complete Animoji Guide for Proficient Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/review-evaluate-and-refine/"><u>Review, Evaluate, and Refine:</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-review-of-moto-g-power-exceptional-battery-durability-in-a-beautifully-crafted-device/"><u>The Ultimate Review of Moto G Power: Exceptional Battery Durability in a Beautifully Crafted Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-savings-with-every-new-iphone-release/"><u>Unlocking Savings with Every New iPhone Release</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

We tested things like viewing angles, color reproduction, sound quality, and more to see if this budget Fire TV is really worth a sport in your living room.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MXH7eY7oDLeZbWXcastu1A7OhpQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-5-2ec275929e8543f0ab9c4ada6276d84c.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle"><a href="#Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle" class="headerlink" title="Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle"></a><strong>Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is thick and boxy, with a fairly wide bezel, and large feet that mount perpendicularly instead of angling like a lot of other inexpensive sets. It isn’t anything special to look at, but that’s to be expected from a budget line like Insignia. The good thing is that it’s fairly light, at less than 20 pounds, and the large feet make it quite steady.</p><p> Most of the ports are found on the left side of the set, as you face it, with a few of them oriented downward instead.</p><p> The power button is situated in a semi-translucent plastic bulge near one of the feet, making it easy to locate, and you can use the same button to switch inputs. There are no other physical buttons on this set, so don’t lose the remote.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones.</p><p> This television uses a standard detachable C7 power cord instead of a hard-wired power cable, and it features a standard 200 x 200 millimeter<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tv-wall-mounts-3276137" >VESA mount <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to ditch the clunky feet and hang it on a wall.</p><p> While this set does have Alexa built right in, it works like a Fire TV Stick and not like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-4172274" >Fire TV Cube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-amazon-echo-4147189" >Echo device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . What that means is it lacks far-field microphones, so you have to give commands via the remote. The remote itself is the same basic design that’s included with other Fire TV devices, but it includes volume buttons, a live TV button, and preset shortcuts for a few streaming services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8ovvGrqb8Me9IvWHrQc7UW02kw8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-4-acb78e6d55e4488ca394495d5c74c754.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password</strong></h2><p> Despite being a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-43-inch-tvs-4588664" >43-inch class television <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance. It’s even packed in a bag that has convenient handles, making it easy to lift up and out of the box and set carefully on a table for assembly.</p><p> This television comes more or less ready to go, but the feet have to be attached if you aren’t going to wall mount it. The feet are clearly marked as to which side needs to point toward the front of the television, and each one attaches with two Phillips screws. If you have a Phillips screwdriver at hand, you can have everything tightened up and the television standing up within a couple minutes.</p><p> Despite being a 43-inch class television, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance.</p><p> Once the feet are on, or the television has been hung on a wall mount, it’s time to turn it on. This presents you with the Fire TV interface, so you should be ready to pick your favorite apps, connect to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430" >Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or wired network, and then log into your Amazon account if you want to get the most out of your new television. There’s also a basic mode if you don’t have an Amazon account or just don’t want to log in.</p><p> The final part of the setup process involves waiting for your apps to download, and then allowing the Fire TV to download and install a firmware update. None of this is too terribly time consuming, but plan on setting aside at least 10 to 15 minutes before your TV is fully ready to watch.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is a 4K UHD television with HDR support, and the picture quality is a massive improvement over lower resolution (1080p, 720p) televisions, especially if you have hardware or media that’s capable of taking advantage of the increased resolution. Game consoles like the 4K-capable Xbox One X and PS4 Pro look great, as do UHD Blu-rays.</p><p> We also loaded up Amazon Prime Video, which includes a bunch of 4K content if you don’t have any UHD devices. Watching an episode of The Tick, Peter Serafinowicz’s bright blue suit popped against the comparatively drab cityscape, and the action was clear and crisp as he bounded from building to building.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles.</p><p> Colors look great across all kinds of different content, but the contrast isn’t as good. Dark scenes seem a bit muddy, with areas that should be perfect black being lighter than they really should be.</p><p> While this set does have UHD support, it’s limited to HDR10 and doesn’t support local dimming. That means the HDR isn’t as effective as you’ll see in more expensive televisions, but it’s still great for a budget TV like this.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles. When backed up to a more appropriate distance, we didn’t have any problem viewing this television from any seat in the house.</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set</strong></h2><p> Built-in television speakers usually aren’t very good, which is why soundbars are popular. That’s especially true of budget television sets, but the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 actually has decent audio quality. You’ll probably want to invest in a soundbar if you don’t already have one, but the sound quality is good enough that you can get by with the built-in speakers if you need to.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones. We also loaded up Amazon Music, turned the volume up, and found that the speakers were loud enough to fill the room without any noticeable distortion. The speakers are definitely lacking in bass, but it’s still surprisingly good for a budget television.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OfRGDj7hZY6nrkoT_HqDEM1S9Ts=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-2-8b38ffeb5ce44c0d9a6c7aa7f6dce4cd.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135350/19272" target="_top" id="2135350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135350/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs"><a href="#Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs" class="headerlink" title="Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs"></a><strong>Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs</strong></h2><p> The ports are split, with some on the left side of the television as you face it, and others exiting toward the bottom.</p><p> On the left side, you’ll find a headphone jack, USB port, and two HDMI ports. The first HDMI port is also ARC capable, which means you can use it to feed audio signals to a compatible soundbar without requiring a separate audio cable.</p><p> On the bottom, you’ll find an ethernet port, digital optical output, RCA jacks for analog video and audio inputs, a coaxial connector for your antenna or cable box, and a third HDMI port.</p><p> All of the ports are well clear of the VESA mount, so you shouldn’t lose access to them if you opt to mount the set on a wall. The exception is that if you use a flush mount, you’ll have trouble reaching the down-facing bank of ports due to the way that the chassis of the television bulges out at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V97gOTfZ6Zys4aZv9gzGupbwRi8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-3-b8a8cb21803f40ada92bf08de6ee6fc0.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive"><a href="#Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive" class="headerlink" title="Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive"></a><strong>Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the Fire TV edition of this hardware. It also comes in a slightly different configuration that’s built on the Roku platform instead, but this one has Fire TV baked in with no option to switch.</p><p> As a Fire TV, this television is excellent. It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks. If you primarily use your television for streaming through apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube, then you won’t have any problems with this television.</p><p> It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks.</p><p> We also tested out the Alexa voice command implementation and found that it works very well. Even with two other Alexa devices in earshot, including a Fire TV Cube, the Insignia’s voice remote picked up and executed our commands flawlessly.</p><p> If you watch a lot of broadcast television or have a cable box, the Fire TV interface can be a bit more frustrating. The main issue is that the Fire TV remote just isn’t built with regular television use in mind, as it lacks a numeric keypad.</p><p> You can ask Alexa to tune to specific channels, and the Fire TV interface has a section for over the air television channels, but the implementation is a little clumsy in its current incarnation.</p><h2 id="Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs"><a href="#Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs"></a><strong>Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 has an MSRP of $299.99, but it’s typically available for around $249.99. Priced at around $249.99, it’s right in the general neighborhood of other 43-inch class smart televisions, including other Fire TVs, sets built around Roku, and others with proprietary systems. There are a lot of decent options in the general $200 to $250 range, but this one is the best of the bunch if you’re firmly entrenched in Amazon’s ecosystem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models"><a href="#Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models"></a><strong>Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models</strong></h2><p> Compared to previous 43-inch class televisions built on the Fire TV platform, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the clear winner. For example, the Toshiba 43LF421U19 is a 43-inch class set that’s also built on the Fire TV platform, and sells for about $299.99, but it’s worse than the Insignia in almost every category. It isn’t 4K or HDR-capable, the viewing angles are worse, colors aren’t as good, and the built-in Fire TV is sluggish compared to the Insignia unit that we tested.</p><p> Toshiba’s 43LF621U19 Fire TV Edition is a 4K UHD television that comes closer to matching the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19, with an MSRP of $329.99, a similar set of ports, and a basic mode that doesn’t require an Amazon account. It also has worse contrast and color range, so the Insignia is still our recommendation of the two.</p><p> If you aren’t specifically focused on Fire TV, the TCL 43S517 is a decent alternative to this set. It’s a 43-inch class smart TV that’s built on the Roku platform instead of Fire TV, and it works a bit better is a regular television, with cable and over the air broadcasts, than the Insignia. It also has ever so slightly better color reproduction. It does have a higher MSRP of $499, but it’s typically available for around $240 to $260.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>This is the budget Fire TV to own if you can’t step up to a larger model.</strong></p><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 isn’t perfect, but it’s probably as close as you’ll get at this price point. This is definitely the UHD TV to own in the 43-inch class if you’re deep in the Amazon ecosystem and really want to go with Fire TV as your smart TV platform. It has great color reproduction, excellent viewing angles, and even decent sound from the onboard stereo speakers.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  NS-43DF710NA19 43” 4K Fire TV</li><li>Product Brand  Insignia</li><li>UPC  600603233920</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.9 x 38.2 x 24.3 in.</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Compatibility  Alexa, Fire TV</li><li>Platform  Fire TV</li><li>Screen Size  42.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  2160p (4K)</li><li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)  Yes</li><li>Refresh Rate  60Hz</li><li>Maximum Contrast Ratio  4000:1</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, USB, Digital Optical Audio Output, RCA Audio Output, Composite Video Input, RF Antenna Input, Headphone Jack, Ethernet</li><li>Speakers  Stereo 8-watt speakers</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Mount Included  No</li><li>Stand Included  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-unleash-your-dj-iq-with-free-luts-for-djis-minis-and-air-series-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unleash Your DJ IQ with FREE LUTs for DJI's Minis & Air Series for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-10-proven-techniques-for-mastering-the-art-of-tiktok-marketing-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 10 Proven Techniques for Mastering the Art of TikTok Marketing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-essential-insights-for-asmr-aficionados-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Insights for ASMR Aficionados for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-creativity-on-the-fly-android-and-iphones-video-magic/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Creativity on the Fly Android & iPhone's Video Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-amazing-features-of-dells-xps-13-7390-2-in-1-ultrabook-unveiled/"><u>A Deep Dive Into the Amazing Features of Dell's XPS 13 (7390): 2-In-1 Ultrabook Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/ace-your-screens-the-premium-guide-to-androids-top-8-capture-apps/"><u>Ace Your Screens The Premium Guide to Android’s Top 8 Capture Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-conscious-caixun-4k-smart-television-a-comprehensive-75-inch-display-review/"><u>Budget-Conscious Caixun 4K Smart Television – A Comprehensive 75-Inch Display Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/discover-what-you-need-to-know-amazfit-helio-ring-specs-when-it-comes-out-and-how-much/"><u>Discover What You Need to Know: Amazfit Helio Ring Specs, When It Comes Out & How Much?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-methods-to-change-gps-location-on-vivo-s18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Methods to Change GPS Location On Vivo S18 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-review-of-the-revolutionary-2-in-1-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-perfect-for-devoted-thinkpad-aficionados/"><u>In-Depth Review of the Revolutionary 2-in-1 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium: Perfect for Devoted ThinkPad Aficionados</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/inside-the-combination-of-style-and-strength-in-the-4k-215-inch-apple-imac/"><u>Inside the Combination of Style and Strength in the 4K 21.5-Inch Apple iMac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s7plus-an-in-depth-look-at-a-premier-android-marvel/"><u>Mastering the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+: An In-Depth Look at a Premier Android Marvel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/remedying-the-saggy-gpu-phenomenon/"><u>Remedying the 'Saggy' GPU Phenomenon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/smooth-transition-to-emoji-15-for-windows-11-users/"><u>Smooth Transition to Emoji 15 for Windows 11 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-mohu-blade-revealed-a-detailed-look-at-its-impressive-functionality-and-original-design-for-over-the-air-tv/"><u>The Mohu Blade Revealed – A Detailed Look at Its Impressive Functionality and Original Design for Over-the-Air TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/unlocking-visual-potential-a-step-by-step-guide-to-video-enhancer-22-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Visual Potential A Step-by-Step Guide to Video Enhancer 2.2 for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Updated for 2019, the Amazon Fire TV Cube brings powerful hardware that can stream thousands of channels and apps in full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >4K HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Dolby Vision encoding. The glowing cube also takes voice commands, basically making it an Echo speaker, but is Alexa’s brainpower and its beefy hexacore processor enough to justify its relatively hefty price tag? I spent 15 hours putting it to the test, read on to see how I liked it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XdJMKZTDX0bcXYVWQa5F4sXhnt0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FireCubeTV_HeroHoriz-bb386a84025b49d2a22d3d34c6974007.jpg"                      alt="Fire TV Cube (2nd Generation)"                ></p><p> Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Futuristic-design-powered-by-Alexa"><a href="#Design-Futuristic-design-powered-by-Alexa" class="headerlink" title="Design: Futuristic design powered by Alexa"></a><strong>Design: Futuristic design powered by Alexa</strong></h2><p> The Fire TV Cube is a cute, futuristic-looking block that will stand out on your home console despite its 4-inch sides. On the outside, it’s virtually unchanged from the first-generation model. Across the top, there’s a blue LED bar that lights up whenever the Cube takes action. The sides of the cube have a glossy black finish that’s a fingerprint magnet. There’s volume and menu buttons on the top, as well, but we don’t foresee a lot of use for them considering that the Cube comes with a remote. In the back, there’s an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI connector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a power adapter port, and a micro USB port.</p><p> In order to give users flexibility in how they set up their streaming system, Amazon’s built-in eight directional microphones into the Fire TV Cube, and another into the remote. As long as the Cube is at least a foot away from any audio output sources (i.e. speakers), it should have no problem hearing your voice commands from ten or more feet away.</p><p> The Cube’s voice commands are probably its most distinguishing feature. Unlike the Fire TV Sticks, the Fire TV Cube also functions as an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa speaker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , meaning it will respond to any voice commands, and more importantly, it has the same capabilities as an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/echo-plus-2nd-gen-review-4772306" >Amazon Echo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In other words, it can control your Internet of Things devices, such as smart bulbs, thermostats, and Ring doorbells.</p><p> You will also receive an Alexa-enabled remote with your Cube. It has buttons to navigate the UI, but it also has volume and power buttons that will work with your TV. It’s small, about the size of your palm, and it has a matte black finish that will make it easy to grip. The relatively large buttons make it simple to navigate the Cube without looking at the remote, as well.</p><p> The Amazon Fire TV Cube is a fantastic streamer for those committed to the Alexa ecosystem.</p><p> My biggest pet peeve with the Cube’s design and features is its accessory bundle. For $120, Amazon could have afforded to throw in an HDMI cable—the $30 Roku Express has one, for instance. If you end up purchasing a Cube, remember to also get an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-cables-and-connectors-what-you-need-to-know-4685377" >HDMI cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . I’ve found Blue Rigger strikes a great balance between affordability and quality, if you need a recommendation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139108/17108" target="_top" id="2139108">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139108" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139108/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Some-difficulty-in-getting-ready"><a href="#Setup-Process-Some-difficulty-in-getting-ready" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Some difficulty in getting ready"></a><strong>Setup Process: Some difficulty in getting ready</strong></h2><p> Compared to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review-4691492" >Fire TV Stick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Cube is a little harder to set up— it doesn’t automatically boot like the Stick, and you need to take into consideration its IR receivers. It must have a clear line of sight to your remote, so place it somewhere you can see it. Additionally, if you want to take advantage of its 4K capabilities, you’ll likely want to use the included Ethernet adapter (and you’ll need to acquire an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548" >Ethernet cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> Once you have your cables connected and power flowing to the Cube, you now need to go through the software side of setup. It’ll ask you to connect to Internet, pick out some apps&#x2F;channels, and log into your Amazon account.</p><h2 id="Streaming-Performance-Fast-streaming-and-almost-no-buffering"><a href="#Streaming-Performance-Fast-streaming-and-almost-no-buffering" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Performance: Fast streaming and almost no buffering"></a><strong>Streaming Performance: Fast streaming and almost no buffering</strong></h2><p> With a hexa-core processor and an ARM Mali G52-MP2 GPU, the Fire TV Cube is blazing fast. Any trouble streaming 4K content is going to come from your internet connection. When I tested it, content loaded instantly, with little to no buffer time and instant thumbnail loading.</p><p> Video looks vivid, and audio sounds great thanks to HDCP support and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dolby-vision-and-hdr10-4060427" >Dolby Vision <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> encoding. I had no trouble getting my content in surround sound and in HDR, without any additional setup from my audio system or 4K projector. Video would consistently stream at 4K 60fps.</p><p> If a show was particularly loud, Alexa had some trouble hearing me, but it was a quick fix by lowering or muting the volume. Alexa never confused the content audio for a command. However, while I didn’t have a problem with having Alexa understand my commands, I would be a little warier if your accent deviates strongly from standard American English. Google’s language recognition protocols tend to be better with understanding other languages and accents.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O-RbJQ9z0Q90LRS1tw4p-LYm-Xc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FIreCubeTV_03-525c653ed76f4b72bcd57495c1bc3142-55e4717a457d48aa8324c37542b70f01.jpg"                      alt="Fire TV Cube (2nd Generation)"                ></p><p>Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Software-Heavily-biased-toward-Amazon-services"><a href="#Software-Heavily-biased-toward-Amazon-services" class="headerlink" title="Software: Heavily biased toward Amazon services"></a><strong>Software: Heavily biased toward Amazon services</strong></h2><p> Software is simultaneously Fire TV’s strongest and weakest point. On the one hand, the quantity of content available on the Fire TV platform is astounding—there’s over 5,000 apps to choose from, as well as a meager library of simple games to play. If you’re looking for something, you will find it.</p><p> However, you will have to find it in a sea of Amazon content. Fire TV’s interface heavily favors content from<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363" >Prime Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and this becomes doubly apparent the further you scroll on the home screen. I happen to love quite a few of the Emmy-winning originals on Prime, so it doesn’t bother me so much, but I can see it becoming infuriating if you just want neutral recommendations (Roku’s software is much better at feeling impartial).</p><p> The home screen isn’t particularly well-organized. Your apps make up the top row, and the rest are suggested content (usually Amazon content). Searching for shows on the search bar will show Amazon results first, and other apps second. Once you’re within an app’s menu, it’s not so bad. Netflix, for instance, works the same as it would on any other streaming device.</p><p> There’s a lot of excellent apps on the platform, from YouTube to IMDb to Crackle TV. There’s weather apps, news apps, and sports apps for all tastes. There’s even a few music streaming apps, including Spotify and Amazon Music.</p><p> If you want an Echo that’s also a media player, the Cube is your best option. It comes with excellent performance, control for IoT devices, built-in speaker and mic, and svelte looks.</p><p> If you’re interested in a Cube because you love Amazon products and content, you’ll be pleased with Prime’s selection of video. There are many, many shows included with your Prime subscription, a lot of them with a stellar production team. Almost all Amazon originals are filmed in 4K, so you can get the most out of your Cube’s performance capabilities. If you haven’t already, you should watch The Expanse and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/21Mjfh9xUyCrX05R6TQdh9JX64c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FireCubeTV_02-603b91304a21457c94312ceb97dfcf74.jpg"                      alt="Fire TV Cube (2nd Generation)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135348/19272" target="_top" id="2135348">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135348" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135348/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire&#x2F;Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993654">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993654">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993654%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993654/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-On-the-expensive-side"><a href="#Price-On-the-expensive-side" class="headerlink" title="Price: On the expensive side"></a><strong>Price: On the expensive side</strong></h2><p> The Fire TV Cube costs $120, which is frankly a little expensive compared to the Fire TV Stick 4K or an Amazon Echo. However, if you want an Echo that’s also a media player, the Cube is your best option. It comes with excellent performance, control for IoT devices, built-in speaker and mic, and svelte looks. While it’s not the best value streaming device, it’s certainly a versatile and well-featured one.</p><h2 id="Amazon-Fire-TV-Cube-vs-Roku-Ultra"><a href="#Amazon-Fire-TV-Cube-vs-Roku-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Fire TV Cube vs. Roku Ultra"></a><strong>Amazon Fire TV Cube vs. Roku Ultra</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to consider if you’re choosing between the Roku Ultra and the Fire TV Cube. Specs-wise, the Fire TV Cube is undoubtedly more powerful and supports more codecs. However, the Roku Ultra has more than enough power to handle 4K content, and it supports HDR, so only the pickiest film lovers would even notice the difference.</p><p> Roku has the advantage when it comes to software, with the biggest and most varied library of any streaming platform. Both its menus and its search function are platform agnostic, meaning it’s simply interested in presenting you the most relevant and cost-effective results. For those that like quiet listening, you can also sync audio to your phone or the remote and listen with your headphones.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator made a good showing when we tested it. It gets high marks for accuracy, portability, and convenience, but it does fall down in some areas such as storing the air hose and power cable. Nevertheless, it’s a handy, nifty device that delivers the air you need when you need it.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility"></a><strong>Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility</strong></h2><p> The form factor of the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a case study in maximum portability. It weighs a mere 5 pounds, and the sturdy handle makes it easy to pick up and move around. Moreover, at 11.8 inches long, 4.3 inches wide and 6.7 inches tall, it’s quite compact. And it’s hard plastic casing means it can withstand some punishment and still deliver top performance.</p><p> Unlike other portable air compressors that draw their power from your car’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V socket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (cigarette lighter) or directly from the battery, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator gives you the option of connecting it to a standard wall outlet. This makes it a very nice item to have in your garage or basement for the occasion where you have to fill up items such as sporting equipment, party balloons, and inflatable swimming pools.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >digital LCD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump. It’s nice, bright, and can be read both in direct sunlight and on dark nights. It displays pressure in PSI (pounds per square inch), BAR (atmospheric pressure), and kPA (kilopascal). If you’re going to use this pump mainly with American cars, you might never use units other than PSI, but it’s very convenient if you ever need to measure pressure in metric or SI (International System of Units).</p><p> The digital LCD is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump.</p><p> The maximum PSI of this portable tire inflator is 90 PSI. This is more than enough to inflate your car tires, sports equipment, and anything else you need. Most car and truck tires have a recommended PSI between 30 and 32 PSI. The Kensun will get the job done, but other car air compressors we tested can reach a maximum of up to 150 PSI.</p><p> This car tire inflator only has a 21-inch air-hose. So you’ll need to place it less than two feet away from the tire you want to inflate. The 10.9-foot power cord gives you some range, but a good deal of it will be running from your dashboard and out your car window. This is about the same hose length you can expect similar products, but it pales in comparison to the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which has a 16-foot air hose.</p><p> The integrated flashlight on the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is pretty bright and illuminates the pump’s working area well. This also makes it more visible to passing cars if you happened to be filling up on the side of the road late at night.</p><p> One of the more annoying aspects of this portable air compressor is how it stores its cords while not in use. Both the air-hose and 12V adapter cord share one big compartment in the bottom of the pump. This would be fine if there was a clear way to fit them in there. When we received our test unit, we were surprised to see that it looked like the power cord was jammed in with no cable management at all.</p><p> When you do finally get it wrapped up, the pump fits nicely in its included carrying case. It’s made of gore-tex, a fairly durable material, so it can take the punishment of being stored long-term in your trunk, and it’s compact enough that it won’t take up much room.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134499/19576" target="_top" id="2134499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134499/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute"><a href="#Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: T-minus one minute"></a><strong>Setup Process: T-minus one minute</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve read the user manual, you’ll know how to use the Kensun portable tire inflator. Nevertheless, you’ll want to do some test runs before you take it on the road. During our testing phase, we timed how long it takes from getting out of the car to the pump inflating one of our tires. It took about one minute, which is good time if you’re on the side of the highway with an unexpected flat.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud</strong></h2><p> When we tested the tire inflator, we took it on a road trip that took us to the states of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Along the way, we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations. In order to use them in the circumstances, they were designed for. Throughout it all, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator never failed to work when we needed it.</p><p> We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> We deflated all four tires on our 2014 Kia Rio to 20 PSI—the recommended PSI for that model is 32 PSI, meaning 20 PSI was dangerously low to drive on. We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> This is a bit longer than the average fill time of the other models we tested like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor pump, which consistently filled our tires in under a minute.</p><p> Any portable tire inflator you use will generate a good deal of noise. Using a decibel meter, we measured how loud this compressor gets while it’s in use. The highest level we recorded was 90 decibels, but it usually hovered at about 88 decibels. That’s not loud enough to damage your hearing, but you’ll have to step away if you want to take a phone call.</p><p> The accuracy was the best of all the air compressors we tested. We compared the air pressure on the digital display with that of a plain pencil-style tire pressure gauge. We found that it was consistently accurate to within a 5 PSI range. Four times more accurate than the 2 PSI range we observed on some other inflators.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long. However, if you’re using it to inflate multiple objects or larger items, you’ll have to take a periodic break while it cools down.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long.</p><p> One of the most convenient things about this portable air pump is its auto-shutdown feature. This allows you to select the precise tire pressure you want before you start pumping. Once the tire is inflated to the desired pressure, it shuts down. This means that you don’t have to babysit the pump while it’s going, and all but guarantees that you won’t over-inflate your tires.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135349/19272" target="_top" id="2135349">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135349" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135349/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility"><a href="#Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility" class="headerlink" title="Price: A decent buy considering its versatility"></a><strong>Price: A decent buy considering its versatility</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator has an MSRP of $80 on Amazon, which is a good price for what you get. It’s not nearly as affordable as some budget models we’ve seen, such as the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump, which will only run you $40, but it gives you the convenience of not having to be tethered to your car to inflate something.</p><h2 id="Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is similar to the Jaco Digital Tire Inflator, they have similar cord and hose lengths, and can continually run for about half an hour. But the Kensun is more than twice the size of the Jaco, so it can deliver more power to fill your tires faster. Additionally, the Jaco lacks the ability to plug into an AC socket, so you can only use it in your car.</p><p> But the Jaco does offer some benefits the Kensun doesn’t. Its built-in light is just as bright as the Kensun’s, but it also has the ability to flash hazard signals for oncoming traffic, and even put out an SOS in Morse Code in the event of real emergencies. Plus, its small form factor makes it much easier to put away and store.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jaco-smartpro-digital-tire-inflator-review-4776811" >Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A portable tire inflator that can work well in a car or at home.</strong></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a great choice to keep in your truck, garage, or wherever you keep your “just-in-case” supplies. It’s a device that is as necessary for drivers as jumper cables and an emergency flashlight. You can count on it to be reliable when you need it, and fill your tires quickly and accurately. Plus, the added benefit of being able to plug it into your wall can’t be overstated. It has its foibles, but in the grand scheme of things, they’re minor inconveniences.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  AC&#x2F;DC Portable Air Pump Tire Inflator</li><li>Product Brand  Kensun</li><li>Price  $79.99</li><li>Release Date  July 2016</li><li>Weight  5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.8 x 4.3 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 Years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-64gb-ideal-for-light-video-content/"><u>[New] 64Gb Ideal for Light Video Content?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-ways-to-fix-it-when-my-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-wont-charge-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Ways to Fix it When My Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Wont Charge | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-transfer-text-messages-from-tecno-spark-20c-to-iphone-1514131211x8-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>2 Ways to Transfer Text Messages from Tecno Spark 20C to iPhone 15/14/13/12/11/X/8/ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-top-gains-on-social-media-secure-and-scalable-tactics/"><u>2024 Approved The Top Gains on Social Media - Secure & Scalable Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-steam-disk-write-error-easily/"><u>How To Fix Steam Disk Write Error Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-tailored-thumbnail-for-social-media-vids/"><u>In 2024, Tailored Thumbnail for Social Media Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-lenovo-p11-pro-tablet-exceptional-quality-minor-concerns/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Lenovo P11 Pro Tablet: Exceptional Quality, Minor Concerns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/insights-on-j5-tactical-v1-pro-lightweight-beam-gadget-featuring-robust-design/"><u>Insights on J5 Tactical V1-Pro Lightweight Beam Gadget: Featuring Robust Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>Step-by-Step Tutorial How To Bypass Samsung Galaxy S24+ FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/take-charge-of-teams-without-spending-a-dime-pc/"><u>Take Charge of Teams Without Spending a Dime (PC)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-portable-gaming-devices-in-2/"><u>Top Rated Portable Gaming Devices in 2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-kensun-tire-inflator-evaluation-solid-performance-in-a-small-package/"><u>Top-Rated Kensun Tire Inflator Evaluation: Solid Performance in a Small Package</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Indoor TV antennas, like the AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna, can provide you with free broadcast TV channels. Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are nothing like the bunny ear style antennas from back in the day. The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115911/19272" target="_top" id="2115911">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115911" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115911/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-breakdown-of-ultimate-chapter-addition-methods-for-youtube-experts/"><u>[New] Breakdown of Ultimate Chapter Addition Methods for YouTube Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-pinnacle-performances-in-figure-skate-22-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Pinnacle Performances in Figure Skate '22 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-shaping-narratives-through-text-effects/"><u>2024 Approved Shaping Narratives Through Text Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/2024s-finest-selection-of-high-performance-17-inch-laptops/"><u>2024'S Finest Selection of High-Performance 17-Inch Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/beneath-the-facade-programs-pause-your-pcs-prowess/"><u>Beneath the Facade, Programs Pause Your PC's Prowess</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/demystifying-chatgpt-enterprise-insights-on-its-unique-capabilities-and-edge/"><u>Demystifying ChatGPT Enterprise: Insights on Its Unique Capabilities and Edge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/enhance-home-connectivity-using-the-powerful-netgear-nighthawk-x6s-range-extender/"><u>Enhance Home Connectivity Using the Powerful Netgear Nighthawk X6S Range Extender</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-excellence-of-the-huawei-p3n-pro-a-timeless-tech-treasure-reviewed/"><u>Exploring the Excellence of the Huawei P3n Pro: A Timeless Tech Treasure Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/refine-your-iphone-hdri-expert-tips-for-clearer-results-in-premiere-pro/"><u>Refine Your iPhone HDRI Expert Tips for Clearer Results in Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/tcl-50s425-50-inch-roku-smart-tv-201n-comprehensive-review-and-value-analysis/"><u>TCL 50S425 50-Inch Roku Smart TV (201N) - Comprehensive Review & Value Analysis</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Laptop batteries are only allowed in carry-on luggage and cannot be inside checked bags. Passengers can carry up to two spare batteries, but they can’t exceed 160 watt-hours each. All laptop batteries must list their capacity on the product, typically in milliamp-hours (mAh). That equates to about a single 81K mAh battery or two 43K mAh batteries.</li><li>How can you extend the life of your laptop battery?<br> There are several ways to improve the lifespan of your laptop battery. Firstly, keep your laptop cool by shutting it down when not in use and never storing it in a hot place. If your battery is fully charged, never leave it plugged in. And finally, you should fully discharge the battery once a month to help your battery life estimate stay accurate.</li><li>How does a laptop battery explode?<br> Fail-safes are in place to prevent “thermal runaway,” which refers to a battery generating more heat than it can handle. This process usually results from faulty manufacturing or product tampering but can also result from overcharging or storing it in scorching areas. However, batteries will rarely combust under these conditions, but they can rupture. Regardless, if it begins to swell, dispose of it immediately (and safely) and replace it.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-c-chargers-4155815" >USB&#x2F;USB-C Reviews &amp; Buying Guides <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-lightweightscreencapture-no-fuss-just-fun-for-2024/"><u>[New] LightweightScreenCapture - No Fuss, Just Fun for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-high-quality-video-capture-for-tech-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] High-Quality Video Capture for Tech Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-share-youtube-clips-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Share YouTube Clips on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-unveil-the-secrets-to-excellent-youtube-thumbnails-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveil the Secrets to Excellent YouTube Thumbnails for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/adjusting-non-loading-conditions-for-enex-on-win11/"><u>Adjusting Non-Loading Conditions for eNEX on Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/critical-evaluation-of-the-expensive-samsung-un65nu8000fxza-smart-tv/"><u>Critical Evaluation of the Expensive Samsung UN65NU8000FXZA Smart TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-capabilities-of-the-blink-four-wireless-led-floodlight-camera-range/"><u>Exploring the Capabilities of the Blink Four Wireless LED Floodlight Camera Range</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/harnessing-preview-for-stunning-visual-edits-an-inside-scoop-for-macos-users/"><u>Harnessing Preview for Stunning Visual Edits: An Inside Scoop for macOS Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-change-honor-80-pro-straight-screen-edition-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Lock Screen Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-text-messages-from-oppo-reno-10-proplus-5g-to-new-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Text Messages from Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G to New Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-amp-up-your-sessions-with-essential-tips-from-zooms-changer-suite/"><u>In 2024, Amp Up Your Sessions with Essential Tips From Zoom's Changer Suite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-for-enhanced-fitness-tracking/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active for Enhanced Fitness Tracking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/netflixs-allure-5-reasons-that-justify-subscription-cost/"><u>Netflix's Allure: 5 Reasons That Justify Subscription Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-home-security-on-a-budget-with-remobells-cost-effective-video-doorbell-s-review/"><u>Unlocking Home Security on a Budget with RemoBell's Cost-Effective Video Doorbell S Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-potential-a-thorough-review-of-the-netgear-c3700-gateway/"><u>Unlocking the Potential: A Thorough Review of the Netgear C3700 Gateway</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars. The overall average rating is 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >Garmin Vivoactive 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Khj7pEOVbeqTsspKEl_3pIItgxc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GarminVivoactive53-573f048663d44d2eb0fbb8614fc6a669.jpg" >Garmin Vivoactive 5. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >$267 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most Garmin watches, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 offers all the key features while not looking too sporty.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> A Garmin Watch is the dream for active types, but they often cost a lot and rarely look great when fine dining. The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re considering leveling up to a wristwatch that can do more than tell time, but want the look and feel of a typical watch, you may be interested in a hybrid smartwatch. The Withings Move falls right into this group of devices that have more capability than a regular watch and still look like a classic timepiece. It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> We tested the Withings Move to see how comfortable it is for everyday use and explore the extent of its smartwatch characteristics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRCqvDOet8fouJ8uY8ze0LlCiog=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-2-1fdc9f06eb6a45f2baa2b840822fba5d.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Slim-and-clean"><a href="#Design-Slim-and-clean" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slim and clean"></a><strong>Design: Slim and clean</strong></h2><p> We don’t typically think of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as being nearly weightless, but the Withings Move is just that. Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> That’s because there’s nothing really heavy in the construction of the device. The back of the face is made of stainless steel, but the case protecting the face is plastic. The lack of weight is nice, but the plastic coupled with the somewhat-flimsy silicone band gives the watch a less refined feel. An added boost to the slim profile is the water-resistance of up to 50 meters, but that seems like a contradiction given the lack of ruggedness in the design.</p><p> Weighing in at just a little over one ounce, this watch is almost undetectable on the wrist.</p><p> At first glance, it looks like your average sporty analog watch. But it’s easy to spot the hint that this device has more functionality. In addition to the usual time and second hands, the Withings Move also features a smaller subdial. This section is labeled from 0-100, and this is where your step goal progress is measured (by percent of completion).</p><p> As far as buttons go, there’s only one, and it’s in the usual spot on the right side of the watch face. It’s not used for winding, though. This is the button you’ll rely on for shutting off the alarm function and starting&#x2F;stopping a workout session.</p><p> Depending on the category you fall into, the lack of a touchscreen could be the largest benefit or drawback of the design. Users who want the look of a regular analog watch will be pleased by the lack of a typical smartwatch screen on their wrist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Qz1dlsE8jl99mXc7-kQ5LCVoiK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-3-b1e97631284d40829bd5714c59dc5f2a.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3"><a href="#Setup-Process-As-easy-as-1-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :As easy as 1-2-3"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>As easy as 1-2-3</strong></h2><p> Given such a simple and clean design, it’s natural to expect the setup process to be the same. We found that to be the case.</p><p> The Withings Move comes with no chargers, cables, or ports of any kind, so there’s no charging required out of the box. All the work is done through the complementary Health Mate app, which we downloaded from the App Store.</p><p> The first thing we had to do was sign up for an account in order to move forward with the installation. After we did that, most of the steps took just a few seconds or up to a minute at the longest.</p><p> First, we paired the Withings Move with our phone via Bluetooth, which was instantaneous. Next, we provided profile information for better activity metrics, downloaded an update, made sure the watch dials were working and the time was set correctly, and we were good to go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135414/19272" target="_top" id="2135414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135414/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping"><a href="#Comfort-Light-as-a-feather-even-while-sleeping" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping"></a><strong>Comfort: Light as a feather, even while sleeping</strong></h2><p> Some watches can feel heavy by the end of the day, but we didn’t encounter that weighed-down feeling with the Withings Move. The watch is really lightweight and the band is soft, flexible, and slim, which made sleeping with it a non-issue. It was also easy to achieve a good fit—especially for smaller wrists—thanks to the plentiful notches and the tab to keep the band in place.</p><p> The Withings Move is not a flashy device with lots of buttons. The button on the side is only used to silence the alarm you set through the app or to initiate an activity session. Because of the comfort and the sleek look, it’s definitely versatile enough to wear on a daily basis. It doesn’t scream “sport watch,” but it’s also not overly decorative, offering an appealing mid-way point between sporty and dressy.</p><p> We did notice that both the front and back of the watch face scratched easily over the course of a week, and suspect this could be a bigger issue for those who are harder on their accessories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WIXFA6BpXvAMWLdKpJ_jmzZh6o4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-5-cbc0f43d847b453bbfae994f03374cdb.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-Limited-activity-tracking"><a href="#Performance-Limited-activity-tracking" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Limited activity tracking"></a><strong>Performance: Limited activity tracking</strong></h2><p> While hybrid smartwatches like the Withings Move offer ease of use and versatility with your wardrobe and daily wear, they’re limited when it comes to tracking performance. Some activities are automatically recorded: walking, running, hiking, and swimming. With outdoor exercising, you can also track distance and elevation with the connected GPS feature.</p><p> There’s also support for all kinds of other general fitness activities like indoor cycling, weight training, and pilates. All you have to do to log these exercises is to wear the device and launch a workout session by holding the button on the watch for a second or two until it vibrates. That’s the same action for stopping the workout, too.</p><p> It offers fitness tracking but doesn’t require you to be plugged in at all times like most smartwatches.</p><p> Most activities allow you to track your speed, activity length and type, steps taken, and calories burned. You won’t be able to monitor active heart rate for any activity, though. And swimming is even more limited: you can only track how long you’ve swum and the calories exerted. The big bottom line to remember, however, is for any distance-based activity you want to log, you’ll need your smartphone.</p><p> We took the Withings Move (and our smartphone) on a run and a walk, and just like it says it will, the watch automatically detected our activity. When we compared it with our usual step trackers, a Garmin 35 and the iHealth app, steps were comparable. For running activity, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the pace was pretty much spot on. But we missed having information about overall pace, cadence, active heart rate, and distance indicators on the watch face itself.</p><p> We also tested the water-resistance while washing dishes and in the shower. The Withings Move is water-resistant up to 50 meters, which, according to the manufacturer, makes it acceptable for lap swimming, splashing, and dishwashing. Even though we didn’t put it to the depth test, it held up to submersion in soapy water and never missed a beat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vaUmI1isQP98tmL8uIZSghmAWGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-6-259d8034cfb64485be60f9c5754fec79.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free"><a href="#Battery-Long-lasting-and-hassle-free" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free"></a><strong>Battery: Long-lasting and hassle-free</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move is reported to have a battery life of up to 18 months, and we really enjoyed that aspect over the week we tested it. Unlike typical smartwatches, we didn’t have to worry about draining the battery and recharging. The internal battery is a typical replaceable watch battery, and the user guide offers directions for removal and replacement when the time comes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/02bkMrpkzqBOue1ffhHNfQqaIuk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4161013-4-df866fafd70a44c592e0e06e0ea53ae7.jpg"                      alt="Withings Move"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115934/19272" target="_top" id="2115934">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115934" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115934/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness"><a href="#Software-An-emphasis-on-general-wellness" class="headerlink" title="Software: An emphasis on general wellness"></a><strong>Software: An emphasis on general wellness</strong></h2><p> Though activity data is somewhat limited, the Withings Move does offer some other more in-depth insights. Sleep activity, for example, is automatically detected and doesn’t require any other action besides wearing the watch while sleeping. When you wake in the morning, you’ll be able to view your quality of sleep for the previous night based on the number of interruptions, duration, and even depth of sleep. There is a hiccup with this feature, though—we noticed when we took it off at our desk one morning, it seemed to think we had fallen back asleep and continued reading our sleep quality.</p><p> Another tracking perk is the resting heart rate measuring feature. This requires that you give the Health Mate app permission to access your phone camera, but if you do this, simply placing your finger in front of your camera lens enables the app to sense your pulse and turn out a resting heart rate reading. The reading could be quite slow if we didn’t remain entirely still, which is almost impossible to achieve completely.</p><p> But that quirk aside, the heart rate feature is an appealing addition to a device that offers few flourishes. It obviously does require your smartphone, but all activity (which can also be viewed on the web through your Withings account) is closely tethered to your device.</p><p> Despite the lack of a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-touchscreen-4144770" >touchscreen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or dashboard interface on the watch, it was never difficult to sync data with the Health Mate app or view metrics. It’s easy and uncomplicated to use for recording or launching activities—including<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-food-tracker-apps-4172287" >tracking food <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the MyFitnessPal integration. Since the app is really what provides the “smart” qualities of the device, we hoped it would deliver on that, and it did.</p><p> There are also a number of other supplemental programs you can sign up for through the Health Connect app in order to up your general wellness. Most of these programs, which are free to join, require a specific type of Withings device, but others, like a meditation and pregnancy tracking program, don’t need any additional equipment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115944/19272" target="_top" id="2115944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-bargain-for-the-value"><a href="#Price-A-bargain-for-the-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bargain for the value"></a><strong>Price: A bargain for the value</strong></h2><p> The Withings Move retails for $69.95, which is an attractive and affordable price for a hybrid smartwatch—most competitors tend to be well above $100. While these other models, like the Fossil Harper and Fossil Q Commuter, typically come with more functionality like music storage or streaming, notifications, or taking a picture from your phone, there’s also a bigger price associated with those features.</p><p> Those looking for a dressier and more substantial watch may find these Fossil models to be better alternatives. Other devices that are comparable in price, like the Fitbit Inspire Fitness Tracker, lack the analog watch qualities and look like designated activity trackers. The Withings Move splits the difference at a modest price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase"><a href="#Withings-Move-vs-Misfit-Phase" class="headerlink" title="Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase"></a><strong>Withings Move vs. Misfit Phase</strong></h2><p> The Misfit Phase is another hybrid smartwatch with a classic wristwatch look, maybe even more so than the Withings Move. Priced at around $175, the Misfit Phase is more expensive, but also comes with a few bonuses that the Withings Move lacks, like text notifications, playing and pausing music on your phone, and also taking selfies.</p><p> On the other hand, the Misfit Phase’s battery life is less impressive (up to six months) and it’s considerably heavier at nearly seven ounces. It also lacks the subdial feature. If you want more impressive looks and some flashier details, you may be happier paying extra for the Misfit Phase. But if you’re a fan of less equipment on your wrist, the Withings Move could satisfy your hybrid smartwatch wishes.</p><p> Are you interested in weighing other hybrid and smartwatch options? Take a look at our roundup of the best smartwatches for women and the best cheap smartwatches.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Best for those who prefer the analog experience.</strong></p><p> The Withings Move is a strong entry-level fitness tracker for the person who wants to track activities without going all-in on a smartwatch. It’s inexpensive, sporty, and subtle, which makes it compelling for those who don’t want to be distracted by notifications and all the hands-on features smartwatches bring to the table.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Withings Move Hybrid Smartwatch</li><li>Product Brand  Withings</li><li>Price  $69.99</li><li>Weight  1.12 oz.</li><li>Battery Capacity  18 months</li><li>Compatibility  iOS 10+, Android 6+</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth</li><li>Warranty  2 years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capture-and-store-every-sound-on-pc-download-x-recorder/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Capture & Store Every Sound on PC - Download X-Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-subtlety-in-audio-mixdown-with-alive/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Subtlety in Audio Mixdown with Alive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-tweet-control-15-premier-unfollow-utilities/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximizing Tweet Control 15 Premier Unfollow Utilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-audio-potential-download-plus-install-guide-for-vrecorder/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unlocking Audio Potential - Download + Install Guide for VRecorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-insiders-list-of-20-storage-services-unlimited-upload/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Insider's List of 20 Storage Services, Unlimited Upload</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/complete-guide-successfully-installing-sandisk-ssd-drivers-step-by-step/"><u>Complete Guide: Successfully Installing SanDisk SSD Drivers - Step-by-Step</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/how-to-record-itunes-videos/"><u>How to Record iTunes Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-triumph-how-to-successfully-address-the-red-error-message/"><u>Troubleshooting Triumph: How to Successfully Address the Red Error Message</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-buyers-guide-selecting-the-perfect-tablet-by-dimension-and-mass/"><u>Ultimate Buyer's Guide: Selecting the Perfect Tablet by Dimension & Mass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-choosing-the-ideal-long-range-routers-2024-edition/"><u>Ultimate Guide: Choosing the Ideal Long Range Routers, 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unleashing-gamers-potential-with-the-asus-rt-ac88u-expert-reviews/"><u>Unleashing Gamers' Potential with the Asus RT-AC88U - Expert Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unlocking-secrets-of-apples-airtag-a-perfect-match-for-your-iphone/"><u>Unlocking Secrets of Apple's AirTag: A Perfect Match for Your iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveil-the-finest-7-websites-offering-previews-of-upcoming-movies/"><u>Unveil the Finest 7 Websites Offering Previews of Upcoming Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/why-the-fitbit-charge-3-stands-strong-amidst-competitors-insights-from-a-detailed-assessment/"><u>Why the Fitbit Charge 3 Stands Strong Amidst Competitors - Insights From a Detailed Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/z-edge-z3-plus-dashcam-review/"><u>Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Everyone loves zombies, but there are so many zombie shooters, it can be hard to tell them apart. But when we played 7 Days to Die, we jumped for joy and grabbed our digital cricket bats, fully prepared to go full Shaun of the Dead on hordes of the undead. A game loosely based around a nuclear fallout that ends with the fall of civilization and the spawning of undead, hungry friends sounds like a good time. Racking up over 500 hours on the game, we’ve tested it across four major alpha updates, taking note of gameplay, plot, ease of use, and price. Read on to find out our thoughts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MW5wYA5ujBjG5LdXn-w9bTJd5WQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-2-a59091cd21c04d99a42270199349fc2a.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-thanks-to-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy thanks to Steam</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die for PC can be located on Steam, making it easy to set up. It takes a little while to download, but once it boots up, you’re in. You’ll press the “New Game” button and you’ll need to create a new character, which is easy if you choose one of the preset characters from the list. If you’d like to make a unique character, it’s easy with a creation system similar to Skyrim. Everything, down to the very arch on the eyebrows, is customizable.</p><p> One of the nicest aspects about 7 Days is that when you boot up a game, and even after, you have a plethora of options to customize gameplay. Do you want Scavenger (easiest setting) or do you want to play on the hardest settings in which the game actually tells you, “You’re one bad mother!”? Do you want the 24-hour cycle to span 30 minutes or two hours of real time? Do you want zombies to sprint at night? How many zombies do you want in your day 7 horde? These are all great options for creating unique and challenging gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Eq0YCIdbj82yj3lOCWEdZS7jX6w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-4-341174c3997543728bd2b024c6e2a309.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox"><a href="#Plot-Open-world-horror-sandbox" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Open world horror sandbox"></a><strong>Plot: Open world horror sandbox</strong></h2><p> When you first begin gameplay, it takes about 20 seconds for it to boot up, and then you’re gasping, holding your bare hands out before you, drinking in the landscape of one of five biomes: snow, forest, desert, wasteland, and burnt.</p><p> A prompt flashes onto the screen, beginning a brief tutorial on how to address the basics of the game. This tutorial will take you through basic crafting, helping you to craft axes, plant fiber clothing, and wooden weapons like clubs and bows. It also helps direct you to the nearest Traitor Joe’s general store, where you can buy vital supplies and weapons—but sorry, no overnight stays. After you’ve finished the tutorial, you get some skill points to spend on your skills page, we’ll cover that in more detail below.</p><p> You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake.</p><p> Once you complete the tutorial, it’s an open sandbox sprinkled with horror and survival elements. The game loosely hints of nuclear fallout, but what matters is civilization has recently fallen and you’re the only person alive. Other than that, the world is yours for the conquering. Alpha 17 does have some smaller quests from Traitor Joe’s, like clearing out zombies in a location, or digging up instructions in a marked spot on the map, but overall the goal is survival. Now, this may seem like an easy feat. After all, zombies are shambling, drooling monsters, but 7 Days to Die may surprise you (more on that later).</p><p> The other, titular part of the plot: every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them. As the 7 days pass, they get harder to defeat. Our understanding is that the end goal of 7 Days is to add a story, but right now they’re focused on honing in general gameplay. We hope that the story will be optional since as a survival horror sandbox, it works very well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U2XChOqkiQvFhP69V0cQ5mYcYME=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-3-d19d9b4d19734cffb022d6e0db90382e.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129740/7443" target="_top" id="2129740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135348/19272" target="_top" id="2135348">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135348" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135348/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall"><a href="#Gameplay-Could-be-better-but-solid-overall" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall"></a><strong>Gameplay: Could be better, but solid overall</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die boasts two playable maps: Navezgane, which is a massive square map consisting of five biomes in which you can use the sandbox world to your advantage; and random map generation, which is a map that randomly spawns cities and biomes. The latter is for players who want a greater challenge, as no random map is the same. The former, however, has fun elements like a school, complete with charging football zombies, and a strip club. From these two kinds of maps alone, gameplay can last for hours (as we said, we’ve clocked in 500 hours at this point).</p><p> Zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, in 7 Days, Alpha 17 updated it so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease.</p><p> As we previously mentioned, zombies are supposed to be shambling, drooling monsters with a penchant for brains. However, Alpha 17 updated the game so that these zombies are intelligent. They know when you’ve crafted and set any traps—and they maneuver around them with ease. It’s mildly frustrating when you’re trying to protect your base from them and the developers have amped it up so high that you really struggle to defend your base.</p><p> However, if you like that sort of challenge, then, by all means, club and shoot your way through the horde and have a blast. That said, 7 Days also boasts some really cool zombies which make gameplay unpredictable and unique. These include: screamer zombies, which alert and spawn hordes with a banshee-like shriek; spider zombies, which can climb through your windows for an unexpected evening soiree; and policeman zombies, who are a solid combination reminiscent of the Spitter and Boomer from the Left 4 Dead franchise.</p><p> There’s also a skill tree that grants you improved abilities as you go along. We feel this skill tree is mildly flawed, as they want you to slowly build up levels and restrict important aspects—like the forge and bikes—until level 20. In order to do this, you have to grind your way through hordes, as slaying zombies is the most effective way to gain experience and level up. If this is your preference, then you’ll have a blast with this game. If you prefer building and crafting, then we recommend opting for something like Minecraft or Terraria. One quick note—because this is a work in progress game, Alpha 18 has promised to restructure this, so this could change when the new update drops.</p><p> One more huge perk is that each building in the game is like a mini dungeon. Filled with traps, sleeping zombies, and lots of loot, it’s a great addition to a game that needed a little extra effort to make the game fun and playable. For example, in one home we raided on multiplayer, one of us fell through a weak floorboard and ended up in a room full of zombies. However, the loot in the house—a hunting rifle, with a couple weapons modifications to make stronger weapons—made it fun, unpredictable, and worth the scares.</p><p> Every seven days, a zombie horde descends upon you. They know your location. They will find you and claw their way to you, and you have to fend yourself and your base from them.</p><p> For the most part, the controls are really easily manageable on the PC, consisting of the basic, fairly universal WASD keyboard controls. If you don’t like the WASD controls, it’s also very easy to go in and alter them. We liked the ease of use, as we were able to jump into the two maps the game boasts without a rough start. We also liked that because of the easy controls, it was easy to attack zombies with melee and ranged weapons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O0do2JbbpgP_VF7azi5OhENnDpc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4164252-5-13eba1dcdd7d45b48c0c3d07711686e6.jpg"                      alt="7 Days to Die"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-but-detailed-on-optimal"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-but-detailed-on-optimal" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated, but detailed on optimal"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated, but detailed on optimal</strong></h2><p> For a game that was released in 2013 originally, the graphics could be a little better, even if you play on optimal settings. Back in the day, we played on lower settings rather than splurge on a fancy graphics card. If you play on the lower settings, it’s cringeworthy, though not as cringeworthy as the Witcher 3’s lowest settings.</p><p> 7 Days has a decent 3D graphics system that they’ve definitely improved as the alpha updates have been released. As a consequence, the minimum requirements have also increased. Those who play on minimum settings may want to take note of that. While we hope they’ll improve these over the next alpha updates, we are taking the graphics as they are at the time of this review, and right now, while they’re detailed on optimal settings, they could be better.</p><p> Because the graphics are a rather mixed bag, the frames per second (fps) can vary dramatically. We experienced drops as low as 18 fps when playing. When surrounded by a horde, that can cost you your life.</p><h2 id="Platform-It’s-complicated"><a href="#Platform-It’s-complicated" class="headerlink" title="Platform: It’s complicated"></a><strong>Platform: It’s complicated</strong></h2><p> 7 Days to Die runs on many platforms:<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mac-4155662" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ps4-ps4-slim-and-ps4-pro-4154452" >PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-360-buyers-guide-3562451" >Xbox 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . We played 7 Days on PC, and at the time of writing, they released a teaser for the Alpha 18 update which would roll out to the PC version of the game.</p><p> Last time we checked, the company that owned all console rights, Telltale, went bust, and The Fun Pimps (the developer) were in legal limbo trying to reacquire their own rights. There’s a good chance that there will not be an update in the console versions of the game anytime soon as this issue makes its way through the courts. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you purchase the PC version if you decide this is a game you might like to try.</p><h2 id="Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game"><a href="#Price-Average-for-an-alpha-game" class="headerlink" title="Price: Average for an alpha game"></a><strong>Price: Average for an alpha game</strong></h2><p> At around $25, 7 Days isn’t the most expensive zombie game on the market. However, it is the most expensive alpha zombie game out there. Because you can purchase it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Humble Bumble, we recommend waiting for a Steam sale and getting it for a discount, especially since it’s still in progress. This way, if you decide you don’t like it in the future, you aren’t out the full price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters"><a href="#Competition-Other-sandbox-shooters" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other sandbox shooters"></a><strong>Competition: Other sandbox shooters</strong></h2><p> It’s hard to compare 7 Days to other sandboxes out there because of the significant focus on crafting and building.<a class="link"   href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has expansive crafting and arguably good graphics with its classic blocky appearance. Terraria also boasts zombies and crafting and building capabilities, though they’re 2D instead of 3D like in 7 Days. And all of them can guarantee hours of gameplay with fun twists and turns.</p><p> If anything can set these games apart, it’s the sheer realism of 7 Days. You need water and you need to hunt, forage, and scavenge to survive. You will feel the effects of heat as the desert raises your temperature, and you will starve as the snow biome depletes your caloric intake. And that’s all before we’ve mentioned the wolves and zombie bears (yes, they exist, and no, they are not easy to take down) in 7 Days. If you like a sense of realism in your zombie games, then 7 Days is for you. If not, we suggest taking a look at Minecraft or<a class="link"   href="https://terraria.org/" >Terraria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If you love smart zombies, you’ll love this game.</strong></p><p> Despite flaws in graphics, there’s a lot to love about 7 Days to Die. The challenging skill tree system and dangerous intelligent zombies add an element that’s not typically found in zombie shooters. If you want a game to commit to for hours on end, building bases and exploring dungeon-like homes while slaying zombie cheerleaders, then 7 Days to Die could be a fun way to ease some stress after a long day of work.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li>The Last of Us Remastered</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dying-light-review-4778324" >Dying Light <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  7 Days to Die</li><li>UPC  017817770613</li><li>Price  $24.99</li><li>Release Date  December 2013</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, PS 4, Xbox</li><li>Processor Minimum  2.4 GHz Dual Core CPU</li><li>Memory Minimum  6 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics  1 GB Dedicated Memory</li><li>Game Updates  Alpha 17.4 out; Alpha 18 Announced</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-flip-it-right-youtube-video-retrospectives-with-tips-for-2024/"><u>[New] Flip It Right YouTube Video Retrospectives (With Tips!)

We had a rough time even making it through 10 hours of the game, latching on to the game’s one highlight, it’s rich and unique worldbuilding.

The game begins with the character you’ll play as waking up in a panic. Someone will narrate everything that’s going on to you, including what the area around you looks like. After a short introduction, you’ll be prompted to pick what you want to play as: Glaive, Jack, or Nano. These will roughly translate into someone more physical, someone mixed physical and magical, and a mage, but of course, set in this strange half-fantastical, half-science-fiction world where everything is new and unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/b1_d8ikgtdkSH_Y0F510q_BXpK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-03-d99b43959fa74b31a15f336852f14d75.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> This whole introduction is slow moving and boring, and getting through it is rough. But even past this, things don’t necessarily pick up and get more interesting. The game has such a heavy hand with its narration, telling you the game’s visuals even though you can see them right there on your screen. The whole game reads like someone wrote a novel, couldn’t publish it, and then decided making a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was a better idea, and instead of trimming the fat, they left every unnecessary description and detail in the game’s prompt.</p><p> I did continue forward, even though I was already disinterested, hoping the game would become more gripping. After the memory room, you’ll wake to another platform where a being tells you you’ve suffered a great injury and they are in your mind. He tries to explain who you are but before he gets too far, you’ll be attacked by something called the Sorrow. Eventually, you’ll wake in the real world, enter the game’s main city, and be able to talk to the wealth of characters living there. You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><p> You’re a castoff of the powerful Changing God, and you’ve got a lot to figure out―the question is, do you want to read a poorly written novel in video game format?</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort"><a href="#Gameplay-Dialogue-prompts-and-effort" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort"></a><strong>Gameplay: Dialogue prompts and effort</strong></h2><p> The Tides of Numenera is a third-person<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-offline-rpg-games-4177675" >role-playing game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where almost 75 percent of the gameplay is scrolling dialogue boxes and the various prompts that will pop up as the game tells you the story. These prompts will allow you control over how the story unfolds, and this, more than anything else, is the game’s main mechanic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8H4QhkgilcsrFlNL40KO1tDnKvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-02-cca6ebdc67d6477ab973b796fb7e773c.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> Beyond this, the other major gameplay mechanic is a system of effort and inspiration. Every action you take will prompt you to use effort. This effort allows for your character to work harder at the chosen action, and thus gives your character a better chance of accomplishing their goal.</p><p> This system is set in place in an attempt to allow you some control over which tasks you want to prioritize with effort―but understand that a lot of the game is built around failure. The game even tells you as much in the introduction. Failing doesn’t mean you’ve messed up, it just means you’ll be set on a different course of the game’s story. Really, I never felt this mechanic offered more than giving players a false sense of control. In reality, the effort prompts didn’t feel like they added much to the overall gameplay experience, they certainly didn’t add any much needed excitement.</p><p> Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> The inspiration aspect is probably the game’s most interesting gameplay mechanic. While you are exploring the world and speaking to characters, you’ll sway them depending on the various prompts. This alignment system will affect the story and what prompts become available for your character. Basically, every interaction you have with another character or within the world will have the potential to alter your character’s personality, morality, and skills.</p><p> Overall, this game was a weak attempt at offering players the experience of a novel in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >video game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> format. The storytelling is very heavy-handed. The writing is weak and full of repeated telling of things you can easily see on-screen around you. There’s little to no direction about where to go or what exactly you should be doing, and combined with the long paragraphs of text, things becomes boring fast. The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way. It’s just a shame that it gets buried under such heavy, inactive storytelling.</p><p> The one thing the game does have to offer is a rich and unique world that combines elements of fantasy and science fiction in an interesting way.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic"><a href="#Graphics-Outdated-and-simplistic" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Outdated and simplistic"></a><strong>Graphics: Outdated and simplistic</strong></h2><p> Tides of Numenera was created in 2017―however, you wouldn’t know this if you jumped into the game and made a guess based upon the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/optimizing-video-game-frame-rates-811784" >graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The graphics look more like they’re stuck in the early 2000s, with blocky, almost pixelated characters. There is some forgiveness to be had because the game isn’t focused on the visuals―it’s more about the words and the story. But there is a limit to how forgiving one can be considering the game isn’t that old.</p><p> The one positive is the originality in the world the developers have created. The setting feels unique―a mix of strange alien tech within a fantasy city. A wide range of characters will fill the game, and they respond and react in creative ways. It’s also a fun experience to run around and talk to these various characters and explore the game’s world and the lore of Numenera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/DfXjCwwtXMVBL58JZmix5sR3vBQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4580331-Torment-Tides-of-Numeria-04-7f9c8617b9cd41738ad2ac02abf0aec9.jpg"                      alt="Torment: Tides of Numenera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982457">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982457.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982457">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982457.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982457%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982457/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115921/19272" target="_top" id="2115921">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115921" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115921/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story"><a href="#Price-Only-worth-it-if-you’re-keen-on-the-story" class="headerlink" title="Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story"></a><strong>Price: Only worth it if you’re keen on the story</strong></h2><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is still an expensive game, costing $50 on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-steam-games-4176308" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it’s not on sale. It’s a game created with a very specific type of player in mind―and I suspect most people are not going to like it.</p><p> That said, if role-playing games with a text-heavy focus are of interest to you, then the game does have a lot to offer for the cost. The world of Numenera is vast, and considering all the prompts that alter the story, the game also has a lot of replayability. While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else, and for those players, the $50 cost will be worth it.</p><p> While Tides of Numenera wasn’t really my thing, it could be a fun adventure for someone else.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136615/26400" target="_top" id="2136615">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136615" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136615/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs"><a href="#Competition-Other-story-focused-RPGs" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other story focused RPGs"></a><strong>Competition: Other story focused RPGs</strong></h2><p> There are quite a few other games available that are story-focused RPGs besides Tides of Numenera. Wasteland 2 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Wasteland-2-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-4/dp/B013CQHQFU/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a very similar game, as it is made by the same developers, but where Numenera falls flat with its heavy-handed storytelling, Wasteland 2 stands apart with a fun, tactical combat system.</p><p> Another third-person RPG that will have a great and well-developed world to explore is Pillars of Eternity (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Pillars-Eternity-Complete-PlayStation-4/dp/B0734T77S2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5077302%7Cnac6eb02defc3413da4da5d4ed0dc77ea21%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). The game will allow you to explore a rich fantasy world and its huge dungeon, and while still rich in story, won’t bog you down to the point of boredom. The last game I’ll recommend looking at is any of the Mass Effect titles. Mass Effect does a great job of building a rich science-fiction world while also giving the player a story filled story-altering choices and decisions.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A text-heavy RPG that doesn’t live up to its predecessor.</strong></p><p> Torment: Tides of Numenera is a role-playing game focused on creating an experience that is more novel than video game. The storytelling is text heavy, but the world is rich and unique, mixing sci-fi and fantasy elements. Unfortunately, the unique world wasn’t enough to carry me through the outdated graphics and boring gameplay.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Torment: Tides of Numenera</li><li>Product Brand  inXile Entertainment</li><li>Price  $49.99</li><li>ESRB Rating  M for Mature</li><li>Available Platforms  PC, MaxOS,Xbox One, PlayStation 4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfecting-switch-pro-techniques-on-steam-platform/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfecting Switch Pro Techniques on Steam Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/capturing-crowds-fervor-an-exclusive-gallery-featuring-the-greatest-fans-at-the-fifa-qatar-world-cup-tournament/"><u>Capturing Crowds' Fervor: An Exclusive Gallery Featuring the Greatest Fans at the FIFA Qatar World Cup Tournament</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/effective-solutions-for-troubleshooting-a-non-booting-windows-system/"><u>Effective Solutions for Troubleshooting a Non-Booting Windows System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-dominion-and-downfall-in-imperator-rome-game-review/"><u>Exploring Dominion and Downfall in 'Imperator: Rome' Game Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-skagen-falster-2-a-stylish-rival-in-the-face-of-apples-dominance/"><u>Exploring the Skagen Falster 2: A Stylish Rival in the Face of Apple's Dominance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/get-set-to-soar-with-the-syma-x5c-an-in-depth-cost-effective-quadcopter-review/"><u>Get Set to Soar with the SYMA X5C - An In-Depth, Cost-Effective Quadcopter Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-vivo-y78t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Activate and Use Life360 Ghost Mode On Vivo Y78t | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/improved-bioshock-2-remaster-advanced-graphics-smoother-gameplay-and-fixed-bugs-for-an-immersive-adventure/"><u>Improved BioShock 2 Remaster - Advanced Graphics, Smoother Gameplay, and Fixed Bugs for an Immersive Adventure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-pursuit-of-perfection-does-picku-outshine-other-android-tools/"><u>In Pursuit of Perfection Does PickU Outshine Other Android Tools?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/simple-ways-to-get-lost-videos-back-from-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>Simple ways to get lost videos back from Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unboxing-the-lenovo-yoga-a940-an-ultimate-guide-to-its-capabilities-and-functionality/"><u>Unboxing the Lenovo Yoga A940: An Ultimate Guide to Its Capabilities and Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-versatility-of-the-amazon-fire-hd-10-tablet-a-review-focused-on-family-usage/"><u>Unveiling the Versatility of the Amazon Fire HD 10 Tablet - A Review Focused on Family Usage</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
