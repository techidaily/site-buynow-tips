Most of the ports are positioned on the rear, with the exception of the second USB port that sits along the side next to the Wi-Fi button. Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes Setup is simple, and you can use the Tether app or the TP-Link site. There’s a QR code in the quick setup leaflet, so you can easily find the app. As it goes with most routers, you’ll find a temporary network name, password, and login info on the label. The app walks you through the setup process step-by-step, guiding you through creating your 2.4 and 5 GHz networks. Connectivity: Decent speeds, long range The Archer C9 AC1900 is an 801.11ac router. It can reach up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and up to 600 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band for a total of 1900 Mbps. The C9 has beamforming, which promotes a more concentrated signal and a longer range. It has four separate gigabit LAN ports for hardwiring devices. In my test home, my ISP speeds are 500 Mbps. On the 5 GHz band, my laptop’s Wi-Fi speed clocked in at 290 Mbps when sitting in the same room as the router. In the back corner of my office, which is often a dead zone, my laptop clocked 66 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. As I traveled far away from the router, I was able to maintain a signal, but the speed slowed down quite a bit. In the backyard, another area where I often experience drop offs, the speed came in at 39 Mbps. I repeated the Ookla speed test numerous times, and the results remained around the same in each room. I was able to get slightly higher speeds on an iPhone 11, but overall the router performed extremely well at close proximity, but not so well at a distance. Key features: Guest network and parental controls The C9 has two USB ports (one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0), so you can share printers or storage over the network. Although this is somewhat of a basic router, it has some modern perks. It supports the most recent Internet Protocol version, IPv6. You can also create a guest network, so you don’t have to share your main network credentials with visitors. The C9 does feature parental controls, but they aren’t exactly comprehensive. Software: TP-Link Tether app You can control the router’s functions from the companion app, Tether. In the app, you can do things like set parental time limits on devices, create a guest network, block devices from the network, and perform basic network maintenance. I also recently tested the TP-Link Archer AX6000, which uses the Tether app as well. The app interface changes based on which router you’re using. With the Archer AX6000, I had more options visible because it’s a more feature-rich unit. I was impressed with the app’s ability to remove those features from the interface with the C9, instead of leaving them in place for me to click on and get that “not available with this model” message. The TP-Link site gives you access to more advanced features, like USB settings for file and printer sharing, more advanced parental controls (blocking sites), access control, DHCP settings, and forwarding and security features. Price: A budget router The Archer C9 AC1900 is an older model, so it’s not as readily available as it was a couple of years back. You can typically find it for around $120, which is a good price for a long range router with its feature set. TP-Link Archer C9 AC1900 vs. ASUS RT-AC1900 The ASUS RT-AC1900 typically sells for closer to $150, but you can find it refurbished or on sale for around the same price as the Archer AC1900. The two routers look similar at first glance—they both have three very long antennas protruding from the top. They have similar specifications, including a dual-core processor, AC1900 speed, and dual-bands, and a long range. But, the ASUS RT-AC1900 offers a few perks, like TrendMicro security and NVIDIA GameStream technology."                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Takes-less-than-10-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Takes-less-than-10-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes"></a><strong>Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes</strong></h2><p> Setup is simple, and you can use the Tether app or the TP-Link site.

It doesn’t include Alexa control or MU-MIMO technology, but it’s supposed to provide a long signal range for larger homes, as well as support fast enough speeds for online gaming and 4K media. I tested the TP-Link AC1900 alongside several other long range routers to see how well it performs in the real world. Design: Fingerprints galore The Archer AC1900 definitely isn’t the most attractive router I’ve seen. The version I tested is black, but TP-Link also makes the C9 in white. The gloss finish gives the AC1900 a cheap look, and it unfortunately shows each and every smudge and fingerprint when you touch the surface. The indicator lights sit on the front face, and you can easily see the network status with a quick glance. The C9 has a slate grey plastic border, which goes around the top perimeter, angles outward, and serves as a stand for the router. The stand allows you to position the AC1900 horizontally or vertically. However, you’ll have to move your cabling under the stand to place the router in a horizontal position, so you can’t easily move it between the two orientations without disconnecting your cables. The Archer C9 has three removable antennas you can swivel and adjust. Although they’re a necessary evil, the antennas are extremely long (almost six inches), so the router looks oddly tall when in the vertical position with the antennas extended. Most of the ports are positioned on the rear, with the exception of the second USB port that sits along the side next to the Wi-Fi button. Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes Setup is simple, and you can use the Tether app or the TP-Link site. There’s a QR code in the quick setup leaflet, so you can easily find the app. As it goes with most routers, you’ll find a temporary network name, password, and login info on the label. The app walks you through the setup process step-by-step, guiding you through creating your 2.4 and 5 GHz networks. Connectivity: Decent speeds, long range The Archer C9 AC1900 is an 801.11ac router. It can reach up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and up to 600 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band for a total of 1900 Mbps. The C9 has beamforming, which promotes a more concentrated signal and a longer range. It has four separate gigabit LAN ports for hardwiring devices. In my test home, my ISP speeds are 500 Mbps. On the 5 GHz band, my laptop’s Wi-Fi speed clocked in at 290 Mbps when sitting in the same room as the router. In the back corner of my office, which is often a dead zone, my laptop clocked 66 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. As I traveled far away from the router, I was able to maintain a signal, but the speed slowed down quite a bit. In the backyard, another area where I often experience drop offs, the speed came in at 39 Mbps. I repeated the Ookla speed test numerous times, and the results remained around the same in each room. I was able to get slightly higher speeds on an iPhone 11, but overall the router performed extremely well at close proximity, but not so well at a distance. Key features: Guest network and parental controls The C9 has two USB ports (one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0), so you can share printers or storage over the network. Although this is somewhat of a basic router, it has some modern perks. It supports the most recent Internet Protocol version, IPv6. You can also create a guest network, so you don’t have to share your main network credentials with visitors. The C9 does feature parental controls, but they aren’t exactly comprehensive. Software: TP-Link Tether app You can control the router’s functions from the companion app, Tether. In the app, you can do things like set parental time limits on devices, create a guest network, block devices from the network, and perform basic network maintenance. I also recently tested the TP-Link Archer AX6000, which uses the Tether app as well. The app interface changes based on which router you’re using. With the Archer AX6000, I had more options visible because it’s a more feature-rich unit. I was impressed with the app’s ability to remove those features from the interface with the C9, instead of leaving them in place for me to click on and get that “not available with this model” message. The TP-Link site gives you access to more advanced features, like USB settings for file and printer sharing, more advanced parental controls (blocking sites), access control, DHCP settings, and forwarding and security features. Price: A budget router The Archer C9 AC1900 is an older model, so it’s not as readily available as it was a couple of years back. You can typically find it for around $120, which is a good price for a long range router with its feature set. TP-Link Archer C9 AC1900 vs. ASUS RT-AC1900 The ASUS RT-AC1900 typically sells for closer to $150, but you can find it refurbished or on sale for around the same price as the Archer AC1900. The two routers look similar at first glance—they both have three very long antennas protruding from the top. They have similar specifications, including a dual-core processor, AC1900 speed, and dual-bands, and a long range. But, the ASUS RT-AC1900 offers a few perks, like TrendMicro security and NVIDIA GameStream technology."                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-A-budget-router"><a href="#Price-A-budget-router" class="headerlink" title="Price: A budget router"></a><strong>Price: A budget router</strong></h2><p> The Archer C9 AC1900 is an older model, so it’s not as readily available as it was a couple of years back.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Canon PowerShot SX70 HS is one of those rare cameras that seems to do everything well, with only a few minor caveats.</p><p> It has a respectable 65X zoom range from 21-1365mm (35mm equivalent), which allows you to capture everything from landscapes and portraits to close-up photos of wildlife and sporting events. It is compact, solidly built, and one of the most ergonomic cameras you can buy.</p><p> We put the PowerShot SX70 HS to the test to see if its performance justifies its premium price.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Design-Built-to-last-great-to-use"><a href="#Design-Built-to-last-great-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Design: Built to last, great to use"></a><strong>Design: Built to last, great to use</strong></h2><p> The SX70 HS is a tiny little camera considering the zoom range it packs in, yet it never felt too small in our hands. The exterior is composed of grippy texturized plastic and features a generous leather grip. We never worried about dropping it, and it feels tough enough to take the odd jolt and jostle in stride.</p><p> Obvious care and attention to detail have gone into every aspect of the control layout, and the camera can easily and intuitively be manipulated one-handed. One of the things we liked best was the location of the power button, which is situated to the left of the mode selector dial. This keeps it within easy reach but makes it almost impossible to accidentally power the camera on or off.</p><p> Obvious care and attention to detail have gone into every aspect of the control layout.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-cables-and-connectors-what-you-need-to-know-4685377" >Mini HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Remote shutter, USB, and microphone ports are included, though unfortunately for audio monitoring, the SX70 HS lacks a headphone jack and hot shoe mount. The port covers are durable and easy to use, and we appreciated the well-placed location of the 3.5mm microphone jack.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Get-charged-up-and-you’re-ready-to-go"><a href="#Setup-Process-Get-charged-up-and-you’re-ready-to-go" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Get charged up and you’re ready to go"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Get charged up and you’re ready to go</strong></h2><p> We found it easy enough to set up the SX70 HS and start shooting. Language, time, and date options are presented upon initial startup. The battery charges externally in an included wall charger and takes only a few hours to power up completely from empty.</p><h2 id="Battery-life-No-worries"><a href="#Battery-life-No-worries" class="headerlink" title="Battery life: No worries"></a><strong>Battery life: No worries</strong></h2><p> Even after extended use, we had barely scratched the surface of the SX70 HS’s considerable battery life. It was still going strong after shooting dozens of photos and video clips, so you won’t have to worry about running out of battery life in the middle of a trip.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-and-Viewfinder-Saturated-and-clear"><a href="#Display-and-Viewfinder-Saturated-and-clear" class="headerlink" title="Display and Viewfinder: Saturated and clear"></a><strong>Display and Viewfinder: Saturated and clear</strong></h2><p> The three-inch, 920,000-dot screen on the SX70 HS looks amazing—perhaps_too_ amazing, as your photos will look better on it than on your phone or computer. The screen is fully articulating and solidly built. Our one complaint would be how easily it picks up smudges, and how difficult those smudges are to remove. An advantage of the articulating screen is that it can be turned face-in to avoid dirt and damage and to save on battery life.</p><p> The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is bright and clear with 2,360,000 dots. It’s not the best EVF we’ve ever used as it seems slightly small and cramped, but it gets the job done. A sensor automatically detects when you put your eye up to it (a function that can be adjusted in the settings), which means you don’t have to hunt for a button to switch the EVF on.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Autofocus-Blazing-fast"><a href="#Autofocus-Blazing-fast" class="headerlink" title="Autofocus: Blazing fast"></a><strong>Autofocus: Blazing fast</strong></h2><p> We were shocked by how fast and consistent the autofocus is in the SX70 HS, even in low-light situations. It rarely fails to lock on to your intended subject, and focus tracking works flawlessly.</p><p> The autofocus is really one of the standout features of the SX70 HS—it makes the camera ideal for anyone who will be photographing fast and erratic subjects. Whether you’re capturing precious family moments, sporting events, or wildlife, the SX70 HS will really help ensure you get the shot when it counts the most.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photo-Quality-Great-colors-average-resolution"><a href="#Photo-Quality-Great-colors-average-resolution" class="headerlink" title="Photo Quality: Great colors, average resolution"></a><strong>Photo Quality: Great colors, average resolution</strong></h2><p> We love the warm, natural color tone that<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-new-canon-cameras-493499" >Canon cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> produce, and the SX70 HS doesn’t disappoint. Its photos are vibrant and it captures particularly nice portraits.</p><p> The SX70 HS performs well throughout its zoom range of 21-1365mm and can capture good images even in low-light situations. We found that like most cameras with small (1&#x2F;2.3”) high resolution (20.3 MP) sensors, the SX70 HS does not perform well at high ISOs. It goes as high as ISO 3200, but we wouldn’t recommend shooting above ISO 800.</p><p> RAW files are rich and detailed, and JPEG images are well-rendered</p><p> It is worth noting the exceptional image stabilization implemented in the SX70 HS. It utilizes a dual stabilization system where both the lens and the sensor are shifted to counter unwanted movement and allow for slower shutter speeds (and smoother video). As a result, you can avoid high ISOs and still get sharp photos.</p><p> The SX70 HS has strong macro photography capabilities and a minimum focusing distance of zero. This is very impressive, and we found that this camera delivers excellent close-up images.</p><p> RAW files are rich and detailed, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jpeg-myths-and-facts-1701548" >JPEG images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are well-rendered, though JPEG images do show the compression artifacts typical of point-and-shoot cameras.

Additionally, you will find two video modes: one that opens up more advanced video features, and one that shoots short video clips followed by a still photo. That second mode is quite odd, and we found that it did not produce good results.</p><p> The camera also has a Panorama mode that produces good results, but it’s severely limited in its options— it can only take horizontal panoramas in a right-hand direction. Also included are a Sports mode, a Filter mode (black and white, sepia, etc.), and a Scene mode.</p><p> Scene mode offers Smooth Skin, which, as it sounds, smooths the appearance of skin in a very artificial looking way, Self Portrait (identical to Smooth Skin), Portrait, Fireworks, and an unusual Food mode that supposedly makes food look fresh.</p><p> But perhaps the most useful Scene mode is “Handheld Night Scene.” This setting takes a series of photos and combines them together to produce sharp photos in dark conditions while keeping noise to a minimum, and it works impressively well.</p><p> A problem with all these automated modes and scene settings is that the images they produce are exclusively JPEG, with RAW being unavailable. Fortunately, Program mode is essentially the same as Auto, and you can enable RAW image recording there.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Video-Quality-A-mixed-bag"><a href="#Video-Quality-A-mixed-bag" class="headerlink" title="Video Quality: A mixed bag"></a><strong>Video Quality: A mixed bag</strong></h2><p> The SX70 HS fumbles a bit when it comes to video. It’s no slouch by any means, but the footage is nothing to brag about. You can record up to 4K resolution, but unfortunately, the camera has to crop in to record at this resolution. Also, we found that footage is never especially sharp compared to other cameras.</p><p> On the bright side, the SX70 HS provides excellent Canon color rendition, so even if your footage isn’t sharp, it will still look reasonably attractive.</p><p> Timelapse mode is where the SX70 HS really shines in terms of video.</p><p> Despite the slightly disappointing video quality, this is potentially a good choice for vloggers thanks to its flip-out screen that lets you view yourself while filming. The inclusion of an external microphone port is also a nice touch.</p><p> Time-lapse mode is where the SX70 HS really shines in terms of video. You can easily access this mode via the menu system, and there is a wide range of customizable options available. For those not experienced with time-lapse video, you can simply select from one of three subject-based settings. Time-lapses can be recorded at up to 4K resolution and truly excellent quality.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> The camera comes with Canon’s Digital Photo Professional software for editing. Canon also has a number of free programs available for download on its website, including Eos Movie Utility for video editing. Though Canon’s software is relatively basic, it’s quite capable for basic editing.</p><p> The SX70 HS includes excellent Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity options that you can easily access via a dedicated button on top of the camera. You can connect the camera to your phone via Canon’s app to transfer images and remotely control the camera, or you can connect directly to a computer and transfer images to it wirelessly.</p><p> There is also the option to connect to a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-canon-printers-4584899" >Canon printer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and print your images directly from the camera.

Instead, it plays it safe and just does everything very well. Two of its main competitors in the superzoom arena, Panasonic and Nikon, offer intriguing alternatives by either cutting costs or offering groundbreaking technological advances.</p><p> The Nikon COOLPIX P1000, for example, has an incredible 125x zoom range, as well as a staggering array of extra features. But it also comes with an MSRP of $999—twice what the Canon costs—and is not so sturdily built. The SX70 HS also boasts much better image stabilization and autofocus.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nikon-coolpix-p1000-review-4691097" >Nikon COOLPIX P1000 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The Panasonic Lumix DC-FZ80, on the other hand, has an MSRP of $399 but usually sells for less than $300. Even with this lower price point, it is in many ways the equal of the SX70 HS. In terms of image quality, it actually exceeds the Canon. But it has a shorter (60x) zoom range and is much more cheaply made, with a shorter battery life.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A tremendously fun camera that is exceedingly well-rounded if a bit pricey.</strong></p><p> For a general-purpose point-and-shoot, the Canon Powershot SX70 HS is hard to beat. It has great build quality and lightning-fast autofocus, and despite a few minor flaws, it just about manages to justify its premium cost—if you can find it on sale, then it makes an even better buy.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve

Read on for the verdict to see how it measures up against other games on our best city-building games list—and for forewarning about those pesky cold waves.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-Lots-of-options"><a href="#Plot-Lots-of-options" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Lots of options"></a><strong>Plot: Lots of options</strong></h2><p> For a city-building game, Surviving Mars offers a plethora of gaming options once you move past the tutorial. For example, when starting a game, you can choose who funds the colony, ranging from a United Space Federation to China to the United States. Each comes with its own perks and drawbacks, and creates new challenges for each scenario. You can also set more harsh conditions to create more fun<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/produce-videogame-videos-for-youtube-3562561" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as pick an area of land less suitable for human habitation.</p><p> As for a real plotline, there isn’t really one—the only kind of plot in the game is the objective to colonize Mars. There are challenges which you can do if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, which is nice, but they’re not a real plotline, and only serve to give you a different angle to colonizing the planet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tWjPu4rcPDZ30Ilhru3tUFnqjc8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_02-d1d5dfcccecb478098ab06a6b5137e68.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=36506229&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><video width="100%" height="" class="rounded-t-md shadow-lg relative z-20" controls="" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" webkit-playinginline=""></p><source type="video/mp4" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.mp4"><source type="video/webm" src="https://aidaform.com/images/videos/aidaform-welcome-site.webm"></video></a><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Performance: Humans have never been so annoying**<p> The game begins with a multi-hour long tutorial program, which I highly recommend you undertake before playing the game. There are so many various aspects to the game—basic needs, threats to your colony, resources to import and export—that it would be disastrous not to get caught up to speed. It took me a total of five hours to complete these tutorials, but I had to restart a couple after a couple operator error moments when I accidentally destroyed my only water vaporizer and had no idea how to rebuild it. So, it will probably take you less.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony. You can build in a more stable area of the planet, at the cost of valuable resources like water and metals. Alternately, if you prefer to throw caution to the Mars winds, you can settle for a more resource-rich area. However, when I mention those Mars winds, I really mean it. In the midst of building your colony, you’ll have to beware the dangers of dust storms. Normally, I would brush these dangers aside in a video game. After experiencing them, however, they’re catastrophic, especially after you start adding humans into the mix. Besides dust storms, you’ll have to face off against cold waves and meteors, adding a fun layer to the game.</p><p> Once you get humans on the planet, it turns into a battle for your life. A cold wave can come around and knock out the entire water supply. A dust storm can malfunction all the machines that make oxygen. And a lack of resources aimed to relax humans—dining, shopping, and of course, that famous space bar—can send them teetering over the edge in terms of their mental health. It’s your job to ensure that not only are the humans on Mars healthy, but also happy.</p><p> One of the biggest upsides to Surviving Mars is that you can choose anywhere on the planet to build your colony.</p><p> In over twenty hours of gameplay, I learned the hard way that humans in this game are not only picky, but they demand the life of luxury the second they step off the rocket and into the dome. It didn’t matter that only twelve called a single dome home. It didn’t matter that there was barely enough of them to cover operating the grocery store and space bar. A lack of space for these amenities fell upon deaf ears. They wanted access to their art stores, electronics, and fine dining immediately. In that regard, I’m a little conflicted; as much as I wanted more shopping options for Mars, I realized not long after humans arrived that Haemimont Games, in reality, gave me a blessing by keeping a bland palate. Plus, more buildings and items become available as research, funding, and planetary discoveries allow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QVd7bcTZ_ZbmQxeJCAcRbA8iomg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_04-e663486372a94a05afa9541d4d7930bb.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><p> The colonists also come with their own unique personality traits, from veganism to survivalist to alcoholic, so they all have their own service needs. You’ll have to factor this into your game as you build up your population. If someone doesn’t get their needs met, it can land them in the hospital, or worse, on a rocket back home. And don’t get me started on the chaos that erupts when humans start freezing during a cold spell or complain when they don’t have enough oxygen. The nerve of some colonists!</p><p> As my domes grew larger and the population started expanding, engineers would find themselves working in daycares and doctors would be working as security guards. They wouldn’t automatically shift over to open positions at facilities requiring colonists with these backgrounds.</p><p> Thus, the need for micromanagement began, and grew into a big thorn in my side during gameplay.</p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat.</p><p> I would have to manually go in and evict them from their homes and shift them to other domes where specialized positions would be. It became frustrating as I built up my population. I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><p> If it wasn’t the micromanagement, the gameplay foreshadowed the slowness of play speed in the beginning. Going into the game, I had no idea how slow it could be. The tutorial said that gameplay can be slow and encouraged the use of the speed buttons at the bottom of the screen. Admittedly, I’m impatient and like to speed up city-builders.</p><p> A good chunk of gameplay before the colonists arrived focused on speeding through slower parts of the game. Once the colonists arrived though, gameplay changed, and I found myself wishing for more hours during Sols, or days, on Mars. It’s a problem at the beginning; later on, not so much, especially when your population grows and you have to mitigate various issues that crop up. Many thanks to the creators for putting in Mars Radio and two other channel options with fun, futuristic music to help get me through until the humans arrive.</p><p> I wanted to focus on building bigger domes to accommodate population growth and build important research centers, not worry over whether my scientists would automatically begin working at those same facilities.</p><h2 id="Price-Decent-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Decent-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Decent for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Decent for what you get</strong></h2><p> For around $30, you can add this game to your gaming library. It makes sense for a two-year-old game not to cost the regular price of new games these days. Even better, if you watch for sales, you can get it for cheaper. Be forewarned though—the other additions to the game, like the Laika Project, will cost you more. The $30 is solely for the base game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xyO7-tOzWWRT_ffxzC7TaIMOwH0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Surviving_Mars_03-9d30e99e7a0b4364bc86c4b40dfc99bf.jpg"                      alt="Surviving Mars"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-building-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-building-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-building games"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-building games</strong></h2><p> What makes Surviving Mars unique is that technically it is a city-<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-offline-building-games-4580415" >building game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but instead of building bus lines, you have to build oxygen and water lines to ensure colony survival. However, just like city-building games, you are building infrastructure. If you’re solely focused on building up a city, Surviving Mars would be a great addition to your library, but so would<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities%5FSkylines/" >Cities: Skylines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). Both focus on creating a habitat from scratch—one just happens to be hundreds of thousands of miles away while the other could be in a tropical or a Midwestern climate.</p><p> If you like to worry about whether or not you are meeting commercial lot demand, or whether you will have to raise taxes to cover the construction of a new fire station, Cities: Skylines is a great option. But it focuses on the present on Earth, so some may feel it’s the same spin on games like the SimCity line that have been around for a while. While you’ll have to worry about budget balancing and fixing congested roadways in Cities: Skylines, you won’t have to worry about ensuring the survival of your people over a malfunctioning water vaporiser.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A interesting new take on city-builders, if you can stomach the micromanagement.</strong></p><p> While Surviving Mars is marred by slowness and micromanagement, the unique gameplay and setting make for a true sci-fi treat. It’s at a fair price point, promises lots of fun, and some fun twists and turns. Just watch out for those blasted dust storms.

These tools are a must-have for anyone looking to purchase a second-hand vehicle, allowing you to quickly reveal any glaring inadequacies the previous owner may have failed to mention.</p><h2 id="Best-Overall"><a href="#Best-Overall" class="headerlink" title="Best Overall"></a>Best Overall</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >Ancel Classic OBD Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/89GEP5wvXrJ2pm04eqq2t7sjeNs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ancel-classic-enhanced-universal-obd-ii-scanner-49eabf2abdfb48d18a3374996f6cc802.jpg" >ANCEL Classic Enhanced Universal OBD II Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G5EA74I?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB01G5EA74I" >$21 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy-to-use keypad</li><li>Compact design</li><li>No battery required</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Low reader accuracy</li><li>Some compatibility issues</li></ul><p> The Ancel Classic OBD Scanner is easy to use, even for those uncomfortable working on cars. It works on most cars made in the U.S. after 1996 or in the EU or Asia after 2000 and supports multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, Russian, and German. The large LCD has a white backlight to make it easy to read even in dim lighting.</p><p> If it turns out that your code isn’t serious, this device can turn off that annoying check engine light. The scanner comes with a 2.5-foot long, well-insulated cable that connects with your car’s OBDII data link connector; no other battery or charger is required as it powers up through that link. A three-year warranty means you can rest easy choosing this scanner.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> No |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> Yes |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.02”x6.34”x1.38” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 9.6 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-leads-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Splurge"><a href="#Splurge" class="headerlink" title="Splurge"></a>Splurge</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >BlueDriver Professional OBDII Scanner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00652G4TS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4156964%7Cn91c90f3b4a4d44d09b7ce17ba754f14511%7CB00652G4TS" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/415766460" >$120 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Works through a user-friendly app</li><li>Durable</li><li>Always stays plugged in</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Bluetooth connection can be a bit spotty</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> The BlueDriver OBDII Scanner isn’t the cheapest option out there, but seeing as it’s aimed at those who want more professional readings than you can get from all-in-one units, that’s to be expected. This tiny sensor, once installed, transmits codes, errors, and information via Bluetooth to the BlueDriver app. This app is the centerpiece of the whole unit, as it’s one of the most beautifully designed and full-featured pieces of software we’ve seen. You can call up codes, search them, and even set the app into HUD mode to treat it as an onboard meter.</p><p> What’s extra interesting about this is the 24&#x2F;7 support, meaning you can contact an actual human if you need more information on a particular reading. You can even have the app generate on-demand repair reports compiled and verified by certified technicians. These repair reports are pulled from a database of over 6.6 million vehicle-specific diagnostics, so chances are, you can pull one up for your specific vehicle.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Yes |<strong>Built-in Display:</strong> No |<strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2.2”x1.9”x1” |<strong>Weight:</strong> 2.08 Oz</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Car-Code-Reader" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Car Code Reader"></a>What to Look For in a Car Code Reader</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39655089&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/wa/01_WA_728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h3><p> If you haven’t had a car code reader before, purchase a simple one.

OBD2 is a universal interface in most cars introduced in the 1980s. While it won’t work on every old car out there, you should be covered as long as it is somewhat new. Almost all newer cars will support it.</li><li>Are car code readers worth it?<br> Car code readers are relatively inexpensive, making them a worthwhile investment if you want to pinpoint an issue with your vehicle without taking it to an expensive mechanic. A car code reader lets you read and clear codes, view basic parameter IDs, and check and reset readiness monitors. This gives you an excellent way to tell if the problem is something you can fix quickly before shelling out to a car shop, potentially saving you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-screens-with-active-8-a-comparative-review-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Screens with Active 8 - A Comparative Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tactics-for-smoothly-importing-movies-to-vimeo-from-wmm/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tactics for Smoothly Importing Movies to Vimeo From WMM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vlcs-role-in-mpeg-4-and-other-file-type-conversions-explored/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, VLC's Role in MPEG-4 and Other File Type Conversions Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-recording-google-voice-conversations/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step  Recording Google Voice Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-transform-your-podcasts-identity-with-ai-name-makers/"><u>[Updated] Transform Your Podcast's Identity with AI Name Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-from-twitter-videosyoutube-songs-to-scribbled-mp3-files/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step  From Twitter Videos/YouTube Songs to Scribbled MP3 Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-innovations-best-vr-tech-for-drones/"><u>2024 Approved  Top Innovations  Best VR Tech for Drones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-gamesnapper-strategies-for-captures/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate GameSnapper Strategies for Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/2024s-high-performance-cable-modem-guide/"><u>2024'S High-Performance Cable Modem Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/a-revolutionary-e-reader-for-book-lovers-the-kobo-forma-committed-to-quality-reading/"><u>A Revolutionary E-Reader for Book Lovers: The Kobo Forma Committed to Quality Reading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/acer-xfa240-review-puts-function-over-form/"><u>Acer XFA240 Review: Puts Function Over Form</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-protection-in-depth-review-of-the-procase-budget-friendly-laptop-case-for-macbook-pro-13/"><u>Affordable Protection: In-Depth Review of the ProCase Budget-Friendly Laptop Case for MacBook Pro 13</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-audio-glitches-in-resident-evil-village-expert-tips-and-solutions/"><u>How to Fix Audio Glitches in Resident Evil Village: Expert Tips & Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-android-gallery-without-backup-on-14-pro-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/"><u>How to recover deleted photos from Android Gallery without backup on 14 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/hydraulic-radius-r-cross-sectional-area-a-wetted-perimeter-p/"><u>Hydraulic Radius (R) = Cross-Sectional Area (A) / Wetted Perimeter (P)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-recording-equipment-for-creating-youtube-masterpieces/"><u>In 2024, Best Recording Equipment  For Creating YouTube Masterpieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-your-account-has-been-disabled-in-the-app-store-and-itunes-on-iphone-15-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Your Account Has Been Disabled in the App Store and iTunes On iPhone 15 Pro Max?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/iphone-15-pro-max-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-in-depth-comparison/"><u>IPhone 15 Pro Max Vs.

It explains the situation in Harran, the city where the game takes place. The game proper starts with a cut scene that shows you on a plane, about to parachute out. There’s no character creation here, although once you get a little further into the game, you’ll be able to pick your clothes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/P3rXmBBI1GdQfgi0vVT9xKcFw90=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-2-db5990d1f64341eaae79e22a71bb8f95.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship"><a href="#Plot-A-character-torn-between-obligation-and-friendship" class="headerlink" title="Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship"></a><strong>Plot: A character torn between obligation and friendship</strong></h2><p> The initial cutscene starts with you on a plane, preparing to jump. Your name is Kyle Crane, and you’re an undercover operative. You’ll parachute to the earth while your boss explains your mission―to find a stolen file―but the second you hit the ground, things don’t go as planned. You’re attacked and forced to fire your weapon to scatter your attackers. Of course, in zombie-infested Harran, a gunshot is zombie bait. Suddenly they’re swarming toward you and things look very dire, until you’re rescued by a pair of strangers, a man and a woman. The man dies saving you but you and the woman escape. Her name is Jade, and she’ll play a big role throughout the story as you try to win her and her brother’s trust.</p><p>Harran is a whole different city at night.</p><p> You’re a spy sent in to infiltrate this group of survivors by the Global Relief Effort or GRE, but now that they’ve saved your life, you start to feel like you owe them. They’ll send you on missions to prove yourself, such as setting up traps for air raid supply drops or battling the hostile bandits that prowl Harran’s streets. Throughout the game, you balance accomplishing the GRE’s task with serving the best interest of this group of survivors you find yourself increasingly attached to.</p><p> This is a fairly linear game with regards to the plot. There’s a main storyline for you to follow, with some optional side quests that you can take or leave. The narrative does a decent job of building up the circumstances for Kyle feeling torn between his mission and these people, and you’ll learn more about the virus as you go, as well as Antizin, the fictional drug that could lead to a cure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8G35q3VsoSEuht_3bqsGm0Pwz-0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-7-d9d2bbe8881e476f8dfb3c13059634ed.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore"><a href="#Gameplay-Parkour-and-zombies-galore" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore"></a><strong>Gameplay: Parkour and zombies galore</strong></h2><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour. Other zombie games focus on having slow zombies you can run away from, or dumb zombies you sneak past, but Dying Light takes a completely different approach. Instead, the basic zombies are fast and almost always know where you are―but they can’t climb or jump. This means you can stay safe by leaping between rooftops, running up ramps, balancing across bars, etc. The parkour feature is the biggest thing that makes Dying Light unique in an oversaturated genre, and also part of what makes the game so much fun. It’s entertaining to cross the city running as fast as you can without pausing, challenging yourself to get from point A to point B without ever touching the ground.</p><p> If you do happen to find yourself on the ground with a few zombies around you, you’ll have a variety of weapons you can smash a zombies head in with. The game focuses mainly on melee, with occasional firefights with other bandits. The melee weapon system has an upgrade system that involves fusing together found materials. The melee combat is solid, and your swings connect in a satisfying way.</p><p> You won’t have to wait long in the game before you’re introduced to its main unique mechanic: parkour.</p><p> There are quite a few different types of zombies, and more are introduced the longer you play. There are runners who can parkour right along beside you, frog-men zombies that spit acid, and hulking beasts that swing giant sledgehammers. It’s this variety that keeps the gameplay fun―until night falls.</p><p> Harran is a whole different city at night. If you aren’t in a safe zone, you’ll quickly learn that running through the city at night is terrifying, specifically because of a zombie type called volatiles. Volatiles are crazy strong, super-fast, and will chase after you relentlessly until you get out of sight―not an easy thing to do when you’re freaking out. It can be a real rush to try to do a mission at night, so if things aren’t feeling tense enough for you, just wait until the sunsets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YctEePpYKsIXQ5kU-hQ8w7o9CDo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-4-1edeaf05c6ba435e9b81e68a13831ac6.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Attention-to-detail"><a href="#Graphics-Attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Attention to detail"></a><strong>Graphics: Attention to detail</strong></h2><p> The graphics of Dying Light compare well to other triple-A titles, though it feels like the developers took more care with the scenery than the characters. Human models look a little plasticky, but the world around you is textured beautifully and rich with small details like posters and graffiti that help make the world around you feel real.</p><p> Character animation is also excellent, and the buildings and other objects within the world offer a variety of ways to jump, climb, and crawl. The open urban landscape of Harran allows players to decide how they want to explore, acquire materials, and fight. You’ll be able to come at certain locations from a variety of angles,and it’s this sense of freedom and attention to the environments that brings Dying Light together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sy9NHLj8JNe2eaeS9HJJdejt6QE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dying-Light-Zombie-Game-PS4-6-56ef808272b544e6a1038f4a5d0280f1.jpg"                      alt="Dying Light"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-cost-especially-with-a-friend" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend"></a><strong>Price: Worth the cost, especially with a friend</strong></h2><p> On PlayStation 4, you can purchase the game for $14, a fantastic value. You’ll get more than enough gameplay and fun to justify a purchase at that low cost. However, if you want to play on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-desktop-pcs-4045927" >PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll have to either wait for the game to go on sale, or you’ll have to pay $40. Considering the game is older now, we’d suggest getting the game on sale (it goes on sale often through Steam). There’s a lot of fun to be had in Dying Light, especially if you have a friend to play with, so if you’re thinking about getting the game, we’d say go for it.</p><h2 id="Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games"><a href="#Competition-Other-zombie-and-parkour-games" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other zombie and parkour games"></a><strong>Competition: Other zombie and parkour games</strong></h2><p> There are a lot of other zombie survival games out there, but that doesn’t necessarily mean we’d recommend them if you liked Dying Light. You might consider Days Gone, another PlayStation 4 zombie apocalypse game set in an open world, but if the parkour was the main attraction, you might look into the game Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. The game follows a girl in a sci-fi world and features first-person parkour running and fighting. Instead of the rough and gritty world of Dying Light, Catalyst takes place in a sleek futuristic dystopia that’s all glossy chrome and burnished glass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/days-gone-review-4778364" >Days Gone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An original in the zombie survival genre.</strong></p><p> Dying Light is a game that took an overdone trope and used it to create a fresh game. Its fun parkour and co-op gameplay make for a great gaming experience, particularly when shared with friends. The variety of zombie enemies combined with the excellent melee combat keep the experience fresh even in the late game―and if things feel too simple, doing a mission at night is a wholly different experience from daylight outings. Dying Light is a great game in the zombie survival genre that we would recommend to most players.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Dying Light</li><li>Price  $14.00</li><li>Available Platforms  PC (Steam) Playstation 4 Xbox One OS X Linux</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-inaugural-directors-shorts-for-2024/"><u>[New] Inaugural Director's Shorts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-impact-with-instagrams-new-algorithm-insights-for-2024/"><u>[New] Maximizing Impact with Instagram's New Algorithm Insights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-securing-your-scene-camera-shake-solutions/"><u>[New] Securing Your Scene  Camera Shake Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-enlightening-editing-paths-to-audience-appealing-descriptors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Enlightening Editing Paths to Audience-Appealing Descriptors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-background-removal-in-images-using-canva/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Mastering Background Removal in Images Using Canva</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-capturing-contentment-a-practical-guide-to-daily-vlogging/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capturing Contentment  A Practical Guide to Daily Vlogging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-craft-of-viral-social-media-marketing-on-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Craft of Viral Social Media Marketing on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-snap-a-different-shot-11-best-instagram-tools-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Snap A Different Shot -

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The original Xbox One controller has undergone quite a few changes and iterations over the console’s long life. You’ve got the original version that launched with the Xbox One, a slightly updated version of that, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-s-controller-review-4770950" >One S controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and then the Elite. Each of these controllers were pretty well-received in their day, but Microsoft carefully improved and updated them throughout the years to make them even better.</p><p> We reviewed the original $150 Elite controller when it debuted years ago and loved nearly every aspect of it, but it wasn’t flawless suffering from the lack of a few key features and some durability issues. This is where the newly updated Elite Series 2 controller comes in. Listening to feedback provided by gamers on the weaknesses of Series 1, Microsoft has put out what is likely to be the last iteration of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-consoles-4156250" >Xbox One controller, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it’s pretty much perfect—provided you’re willing to pay the hefty price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t8wI_yN2s_uIQ1leo87MmOnXxb4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-5-0c39ec4e89eb45b094471681efec0e7d.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed"><a href="#Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed" class="headerlink" title="Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed"></a><strong>Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed</strong></h2><p> The general format of the Elite Series 2 takes the basic XB1 controller and builds upon that excellent design by adding in tons of extras and features. However, unlike the first Elite controller, this version uses the newer One S model controller as its basis. This means there is no more two-piece design where the top and bottom shells of the controller are separate. The build is less flashy perhaps, no longer sporting a two-tone finish, but it makes it feel much more solid and creates a sleeker look.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout. The original Elite used brushed aluminum as an accent tone, but that’s been swapped for a darker gunmetal finish that I personally love. This accent tone is found along the top bumpers and triggers (that are now textured plastic), as well as the analog sticks and Xbox&#x2F;home button. You’ll also notice that the mini<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the top is now USB Type-C. Aside from my personal dream of this USB port becoming the universal design for all electronics, this implementation offers a superior port with better data transfer speeds and quicker charging times, so it’s nice to see here.</p><p> The grips this time have been heavily revamped (a welcome change as they were a point of weakness for durability on the Series 1), wrapping around the back, sides, and front for a seamless texture. Also changed from the previous Elite, these grips are no longer grey, but instead a nice black tone to match the rest of this black beauty.</p><p> For the face of the Series 2, the four iconic Xbox buttons are unchanged, but there are a few small changes elsewhere. The toggle switch from the Series 1 has now been swapped for a simple push-button that allows you to toggle between premade profiles with even more flexibility. It is easier to accidentally push, but we didn’t find it to be an issue.</p><p> One of the most striking changes to this area is the D-pad, which no longer sticks out from the design with its shiny aluminum surface. This time around, it’s sporting a flat black color that meshes much better with the overall look of the Series 2. It’s still got the radar-dish design that I personally find to be one of the best D-pad designs for any controller ever made.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout.</p><p> The rear of the Series 2 is slightly different from its predecessor, mainly the lack of a removable battery. Now this change is a bit polarizing for two main reasons. A rechargeable battery is super convenient since you can simply plug it in and juice it up, never having to worry about scrambling around for new batteries. On the other hand, this battery, like all rechargeable batteries, will ultimately wear down and eventually need replacing, which you can no longer do on your own. Much like smartphones that have ditched removable batteries, it seems like more and more devices are forgoing that option. We personally love the rechargeable pack included and supposedly it’ll last 10 years, but when it does get worn out, your only option is to send it in to have Microsoft replace it.</p><p> There is also a minimal charging strip where the battery sits, allowing you to use the included dock plugged into your USB-C cord to charge the controller when not in use. This dock is an excellent perk of the Series 2, negating the need for third-party docks that are often plagued with issues. I found it convenient to leave this dock plugged into the Xbox all the time so that I could place the controller there for a quick charge between gaming sessions or at the end of the night.</p><p> Battery aside, the rear of the Series 2 also features the optional paddles and extra buttons if you like to use those for added customization. The only difference with these is the finish, which now matches the dark tone of the D-pad. Lastly, the hair triggers return, but now have three different settings instead of two, providing even more potential customizing.</p><p> The final part of the design we’d like to discuss is the case. The first Elite also included a case, but this too has been refreshed for the Series 2. The first thing of note is that it isn’t quite the same case just rehashed. Close inspection shows that the material has also been changed a bit, making it smoother and less scratchy. The zipper also uses the new gunmetal finish. One of the more important changes to the case is that the top now includes a port for the charging dock, so you can even charge your controller right inside the case.</p><p> Inside the case, the material has also been swapped from grey to black to continue the darker theme of the Series 2. You’ll also notice the foam pad is no longer here, as that’s where the dock sits. This dock can be removed or used inside the case and attaches with a strong magnet. The last two parts of the case are unchanged from Series 1, with a mesh cradle for accessories on the top and a foam organizer to hold all the swappable thumbsticks and paddles when not in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRrezKVbAUPs2Rud3g4_iOHyxB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-2-4b3f9d8acd1440089989378253d902f4.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254762&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/11_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy"><a href="#Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy"></a><strong>Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy</strong></h2><p> The original Elite was perhaps the most comfortable controller I’ve ever used, so with the Series 2, I had high hopes in this department. Thanks to some clever but subtle changes by the Microsoft team, this controller is even better.</p><p> The main points of ergonomic superiority the Elite has over the cheaper XB1 controllers stem from the finish, grips and sheer customization that allows each user to tailor their controller to their preference. With so many options between different combinations of thumbsticks, D-pads, and paddles, everyone can find their optimal setup after some experimenting.</p><p> The grips are perhaps the most important part of this realm since that’s where your hands will be in contact with the controller most of the time. Luckily, they’re even better on the Series 2. While the original Elite only had rubberized grips along the back, the Series 2 has them wrapped around the full circumference of the device. This means your hands rest on them completely, providing a nice grippy surface that never gets slippery.</p><p> The last point of comfort I appreciated on the Series 2 is the textured triggers. While somewhat gimmicky, I found it to be better suited for quickly identifying between the triggers and bumpers, similar to how the home row on your keyboard has bumps on it.</p><p> The only real issue some users may see as a downside of this controller is that it’s quite a hefty device. The controller weighs 348 grams with all attachments, so it might take some getting used to compared to the 210 gram S controller. I personally love the bulk, as it feels premium, but it might not be for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cS5fpyPSlqvyETs-nGxTtAB3vXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-4-070b6c59b206457ba1068704bbe7bca9.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last"></a><strong>Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last</strong></h2><p> One of our biggest gripes with the original Elite controller was that it lacked Bluetooth functionality despite its premium price tag. Seeing how the much cheaper ONE S variant included this, it was even more frustrating. Thankfully, Microsoft listened to our collective rants and added Bluetooth to the Series 2, which drastically improves the number of devices it can be used with.</p><p> The overall setup process for the new Series 2 is quick and simple (more so than the first Elite). So let’s cover how to use it with both your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and PC. First things first, make sure the rechargeable battery is sufficiently charged (it comes charged out of the box) and you’re ready to pair it with the console.</p><p> To do so, turn on your console first and wait for it to fully boot. Now power on the controller and hold down the pairing button on the top until the Xbox symbol flashes. Then do the same thing on your console’s pairing button until both begin to rapidly flash (this indicates they are searching for each other). Once paired, the flashing will slow and then stop completely to show they have successfully paired.</p><p> As we stated earlier, the inclusion of Bluetooth means using the Series 2 with your PC is even easier than previous<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox One controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For those who plan to use their Elite Series 2 with a PC, this is perhaps the single best upgrade over the Series 1, because you no longer need the annoyingly large adapter to pair it with your PC (also saving you an additional $25).</p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC.</p><p> To do this, first ensure your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and your controller is also updated. Next, you can turn on the controller and head to the computer. At your desktop, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices, then turn Bluetooth on so it can discover the controller. After doing so, you should see “Xbox Wireless Controller” pop up, and you can now click “pair” from there and you’re ready to game.</p><p> For those who want to use their PC for local multiplayer games, it should also be noted that you can only connect one Bluetooth controller to your PC at a time. In addition to that limitation, you also can’t use any attachments like headsets, chat pads or the stereo adapter in this mode.</p><p> If you plan to buy this controller to use with other electronics that support Bluetooth devices, make sure you do some research before committing to it, as it doesn’t always work with everything. That said, we did manage to pair the controller with a couple other devices that weren’t officially supported.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v25KBj3XhkgWMjFaqVnLVUUJqSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-3-29dc70adabc64f888db60e817695153f.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability"><a href="#Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability" class="headerlink" title="Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability"></a><strong>Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability</strong></h2><p> To test the performance of the new Elite Series 2 controller, I put this device through several hours of gaming on both PC and Xbox One platforms running a number of games and layouts. The results were promising, so let’s take a closer look.</p><p> Enhanced performance in games is one of the big selling points of the Elite, which is marketed towards players who want to gain an advantage over those with regular controllers. While subtle, I did feel that the Elite improved some small aspects of my gameplay, though skill trumps this in every way.</p><p> For things like shooters, the hair triggers will give you a slight increase to reaction time, as there is less pull, but it takes some getting used to. The longer thumbsticks supposedly help with things like aim time, but getting used to them requires a bit of relearning to get the muscle memory rewired. Personally, I prefer the shorter sticks, but to each their own.</p><p> The paddles are great for adding additional functionality to your controller that non-Elite controllers can’t touch. For racing games like Forza, using these to shift gears means you can do so without having to move your fingers from other buttons. However, because these are unique to the Elite controllers, new users will have a steep learning curve to successfully implement them into their gameplay.</p><p> This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console.</p><p> The enhanced D-pad is perhaps my favorite piece of kit to instantly improve gaming performance. For things like platformers or fighting games, the dish design is exceptionally good at helping you to nail combos or tricky movements, and I always have it equipped.</p><p> No matter what games we used the Series 2 with, from Destiny 2 to Dragon Ball Fighter Z and more, we felt the controller added a subtle but noticeable boost to performance over a regular controller. That being said, it won’t drastically make you better, so don’t get your hopes up.</p><p> In terms of durability, this new Series 2 addresses several weaknesses of the Series 1. The rubber grips used to be a particularly weak point, coming unglued from the body over time. It seems like Microsoft have fixed this, but only time will tell.</p><p> The bumpers on every XB1 controller up until the One S were another point of failure due to the thin plastic piece that attached them to the controller. If you dropped your controller in just the right spot, even from a short height, they often broke and flopped around, requiring you to either send it in for repair or fix it yourself at home. The original Elite also suffered from this, and I experienced this with my first device. Now that the Series 2 is built off the S controller, this is supposedly no longer an issue.</p><p> While we didn’t experience any durability issues with our controller, the long-term durability will need to be assessed at a later date, though it seems to have gotten some upgrades to resolve issues of the past.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console"><a href="#Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console" class="headerlink" title="Price: Like buying a brand new console"></a><strong>Price: Like buying a brand new console</strong></h2><p> Right now, the Elite Series 2 controller retails at an MSRP of $249.99, about $100 more than its predecessor. This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console (or three brand new titles). That can be a tough sell for your average gamer.</p><p> Sure, all of the included extras, customization potential, and the ultra-premium feel is nice, but does that warrant the cost? Well, that’s for you to decide ultimately, but if you do plan on fully utilizing the customization potential, it’s probably worth it. Otherwise, the One S is probably sufficient.</p><p> The argument could be made that considering you get a Bluetooth controller capable of working on XB1 and PC, a charging dock and a nice little case to keep it all together, the cost isn’t awful. But if you want all of those things for less, you can grab an S controller, dock and case for far, far less.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6VfCJGOyjLkAkE_mjiHr7rz8Gyw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-6-0c1d7a2ae4e8443ea5b69f559e52bd12.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3546200&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.binteko.com/sites/default/files/banner01_468x60a.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller"><a href="#Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller"></a><strong>Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller</strong></h2><p> Since the Elite controller really is in a league of its own, the biggest competitor to it is the first generation, which can still be purchased from a number of retailers. We’re going to quickly compare the two to see which might be best for you.</p><p> So we’ve covered a lot of the differences between the two series throughout this article, and while the second iteration is much improved over the first, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >original Elite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a perfectly capable controller with most of the same features. Now that the new one is out, the older model has also dropped a bit in price—making it more appealing. The price of the Series 1 can vary wildly from as little as $100 all the way up to the original tag of $150 depending on where you look, but saving up to $80 for a controller with mostly the same features is an excellent way to get into the Elite series for less.</p><p> Cost aside, there are a few key things you’ll lose if you go with the first model. Perhaps the most noteworthy advantage the Series 2 has is Bluetooth connectivity. This key feature means you no longer need the obtrusive USB wireless adapter to use it with a PC, and it’ll also work with more devices. The other major advantage is the durability improvements on the second iteration, which should make it last even longer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A truly awesome controller with a steep price point.</strong></p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC. However, the steep price point might be a hard pill to swallow for users who don’t like to splurge.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  400063527030</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Weight  2.89 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 3.6 x 7.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Type  Elite</li><li>Wired&#x2F;Wireless  Wireless</li><li>Removable Cable  Yes</li><li>Battery life  ~40 hours</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;outputs  USB Type-C, 3.5mm jack, Xbox data port</li><li>Warranty  90-day warranty</li><li>Compatibility  All Xbox One Consoles, Windows 10 PCs, Bluetooth devices</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-potential-of-non-mic-sound-capture-methods/"><u>[New] Unlocking the Potential of Non-Mic Sound Capture Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-free-mobile-downloader-the-ultimate-apps-for-video-buffs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Free Mobile Downloader  The Ultimate Apps for Video Buffs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-cinematic-wonders-with-hero5-black-a-filmmakers-companion/"><u>[Updated] Cinematic Wonders with Hero5 Black  A Filmmaker's Companion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-examination-of-videoshow-24/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Examination of VideoShow '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-quick-access-to-trending-tiktok-backdrops/"><u>[Updated] Quick Access to Trending TikTok Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-top-12-best-tycoon-games-to-kill-time-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 12 Best Tycoon Games to Kill Time for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-youtube-vision-navigating-video-degrees-with-ease/"><u>[Updated] YouTube Vision  Navigating Video Degrees with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfecting-your-voice-with-the-ultimate-guide-to-morphvox-modification/"><u>2024 Approved  Perfecting Your Voice with the Ultimate Guide to MorphVOX Modification</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-up-video-standards-choose-among-top-9-webcam-filters/"><u>2024 Approved  Step Up Video Standards  Choose Among Top 9 Webcam Filters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/about-tecno-camon-20-pro-5g-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>About Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G FRP Bypass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/acer-aspire-c27-the-ultimate-blend-of-efficiency-and-functionality-in-a-low-profile-desktop/"><u>Acer Aspire C27: The Ultimate Blend of Efficiency and Functionality in a Low-Profile Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/antenna-showcase-how-the-antop-at-127-delivers-free-television-in-a-stylish-package/"><u>Antenna Showcase - How the Antop AT-127 Delivers FREE Television in a Stylish Package</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-amazon-basics-flat-antenna-unlocking-free-hdtv-channels/"><u>Budget-Friendly Amazon Basics Flat Antenna - Unlocking Free HDTV Channels!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/chatgpt-plus-is-it-worth-the-investment-top-5-benefits-explained/"><u>ChatGPT Plus: Is It Worth the Investment?

However, after a few weeks with this awesome little device, I’m now a firm believer in its merits as both a means towards achieving a healthier lifestyle and as a minimalist smartwatch. It has succeeded in putting me on the path towards meaningful weight loss where countless diets and New Years’ resolutions have failed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Minimalist-masterpiece"><a href="#Design-Minimalist-masterpiece" class="headerlink" title="Design: Minimalist masterpiece"></a><strong>Design: Minimalist masterpiece</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Charge 4 is sleek and stylish with a futuristic flare. The patterned strap is attractive and catches the light in interesting ways. The square screen is practical, but may not appeal to folks who prefer round watches. It feels pretty durable, and it’s waterproof down to 50 meters. After a number of rigorous outdoor adventures, it’s come through unscathed. The Charge 4 comes with a charging station and both small and large wristbands. It’s easy to swap the wrist bands out, and Fitbit sells a variety of alternative styles.</p><p> It has succeeded in putting me on the path towards meaningful weight loss where countless diets and New Years’ resolutions have failed.</p><p> A quick press of the button on the side of the watch takes you back to the clock face or turns it on if it fails to show up automatically when you move your wrist (which does happen, albeit infrequently).

You’ve got to enter a bunch of information about yourself, including name, birth date, weight, and gender. Next, the app shows a helpful animation of how to attach the charger. I like the smiley face the device gives you when it starts charging; it’s a small touch, but it gives the Charge 4 a little jolt of personality.</p><p> After this, it was time to actually pair the Charge 4 to my phone, and after an annoying Squaretrade “Fitbit protection plan” ad, I needed to install an update. While that was downloading I was given a list of first-time user guides. This was useful, with plenty of information about how to use the device, though I would have preferred a printed manual. After the device is up to date, a further set of animated guides showed me the various controls and gestures used to navigate the Charge 4. Finally, the app had a few product care tips and another annoying ad (this time for a Fitbit Premium account) and was ready to go.</p><h2 id="Comfort-A-good-fit"><a href="#Comfort-A-good-fit" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: A good fit"></a><strong>Comfort: A good fit</strong></h2><p> As someone with ridiculously large wrists, I really appreciated that the Charge 4 comes with a larger watch band. It was easy to switch out the band by depressing a recessed button on the underside of the watch, and between the two included bands, the Charge 4 should fit just about anyone. I was surprised by just how comfortable this smartwatch was for me; the larger band has plenty of room to spare even on my wrists.</p><p> As someone with ridiculously large wrists, I really appreciated that the Charge 4 comes with a larger watch band.</p><h2 id="Performance-A-digital-fitness-coach"><a href="#Performance-A-digital-fitness-coach" class="headerlink" title="Performance: A digital fitness coach"></a><strong>Performance: A digital fitness coach</strong></h2><p> No fitness tracker is 100% accurate, and the Charge 4 is no exception, but that’s not as much of a problem as you might assume. Though everything from step counts to elevation change to calories expended and consumed has margins for error, they nonetheless give you goals to work towards, and this rough data is perfectly adequate to help you become more conscious of your physical health.</p><p> Despite small variances in reporting vs. the actual number of steps I was taking or calories I was consuming, this device made me more aware of how much exercise I was getting and how much I was eating. This encouraged me to get more exercise and eat healthier. Also, it’s worth noting that the Charge 4 tracks so many different stats that the cumulative data from such a large variety of factors helps to iron out irregularities from any given reading.</p><p> Sleep tracking is a cool feature, and it seemed to have a pretty good idea of when I was asleep and when I was awake, though sometimes it would fail to record detailed statistics for no discernable reason. Heart Rate tracking isn’t bad either, though my impression is that it was estimating my heart rate somewhat high.</p><p> Calorie tracking was most useful to me, as it gave me a rough estimate to compare to my caloric intake. By entering every meal I ate into the app, I got an idea of how much I could eat during the day and how much exercise I needed to get. Because of this I have been going for more walks and eating healthier. I have almost entirely cut snacks out of my day, and I find myself doing circles around the driveway or going up and down flights of stairs in order to be able to have a little dessert after dinner.</p><p> I didn’t find personalized exercise reminders, the workout intensity map, or exercise tracking to be particularly helpful, but that’s very much a matter of personal preference. In terms of navigation and functionality, the Charge 4 functions very well without much in the way of lag, and the interface is easy to navigate. The only problem comes when you get below 20% battery. A power-saving mode kicks in at that point and the functionality of the watch drops significantly. You’ll want to charge it before it gets to this point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UlCfm0YzhPSZMR3WWRs3oeCWPsA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-2-6afa07ba83e74effb1bd3521b2b43391-3287de2174dc42359f46f06e6576d80b.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-Intuitive-but-ad-infested"><a href="#Software-Intuitive-but-ad-infested" class="headerlink" title="Software: Intuitive but ad infested"></a><strong>Software: Intuitive but ad infested</strong></h2><p> Both the interface of the watch and the companion app for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ios-1994355" >IOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-android-1616887" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> function nearly flawlessly. Menus are easy to navigate, and data is both in-depth while also being easy to access and analyze. Though the hardware itself is a marvel of design and miniaturization, the software is where the magic happens. The Charge 4 essentially turns weight loss and healthy living into a game, and for me, this is an addictive and rewarding game indeed.</p><p> One thing to consider is that some features such as sleep score details and custom challenges are locked behind a steep paywall that will run you $10 a month or $80 per year. It’s pretty easy to set up a subscription like this, never use it, and forget to cancel it until years later when you’ve spent a hefty chunk of change on the service. Annoyingly, the ad for this premium service is permanently affixed to the toolbar in the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wFO4EEqsgPPy2Dq-eUgUTZ1q70A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fitbit-Charge-4-Fitness-Tracker-3-38e2a0e1ea5a46ee85939b8dec6d6a48.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Charge 4"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Life-Awesome-but-with-caveats"><a href="#Battery-Life-Awesome-but-with-caveats" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Awesome, but with caveats"></a><strong>Battery Life: Awesome, but with caveats</strong></h2><p> The Charge 4 lasts about six days on a charge under typical use, which is better than most advanced smartwatches. It charges quickly and most of the time isn’t something you have to worry about.</p><p> However, I did run into a few issues worth mentioning. First of all, when the battery drops below 20% the Charge 4 seems to go into a power-saving mode that limits functionality. Secondly, using features like exercise tracking that use the GPS will drain the battery much more quickly. When I embarked with a full charge on a two-day backpacking trip and set the Charge 4 to record the hike as an exercise it only lasted me through roughly 75% of the two days of trekking.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Good-value"><a href="#Price-Good-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Good value"></a><strong>Price: Good value</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $150 the Fitbit Charge 4 is somewhat expensive but fairly priced for a basic smartwatch.

Despite a few minor flaws such as a subscription paywall for some features and battery hogging GPS I can heartily recommend the Charge 4.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Charge 4 Fitness Tracker</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>Price  $150.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  1.4 x 0.9 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  90 days</li><li>Battery  Up to 6 Days</li><li>Waterproof  Yes</li><li>Heart rate tracking  YES</li><li>GPS  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-disrupt-bot-patterns-for-natural-viewer-increase-for-2024/"><u>[New] Disrupt Bot Patterns for Natural Viewer Increase for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-a-beginners-journey-into-gameplay-capturing-with-obs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Beginner's Journey Into Gameplay Capturing with OBS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-bridging-gaps-in-communication-automating-story-captions/"><u>[Updated] Bridging Gaps in Communication  Automating Story Captions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-direct-transfer-path-youtube-content-to-dailymotion-hub/"><u>[Updated] Direct Transfer Path  YouTube Content to Dailymotion Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-strategizing-your-approach-highlight-and-story-downloads/"><u>[Updated] Strategizing Your Approach  Highlight & Story Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-winters-chill-and-your-videos-selecting-heated-backdrops/"><u>[Updated] Winter's Chill & Your Videos  Selecting Heated Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2023s-top-pick-of-affordable-live-stream-tech-for-every-platform-user/"><u>2023'S Top Pick of Affordable Live Stream Tech for Every Platform User</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-avoiding-content-id-alerts-strategies-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  Avoiding Content ID Alerts  Strategies on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-compelling-narratives-key-market-words-and-phrases/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Compelling Narratives  Key Market Words and Phrases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-second-screen-craftsman/"><u>2024 Approved  Second-Screen Craftsman</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-into-vlogging-fundamental-gear-and-applications/"><u>2024 Approved  Step Into Vlogging  Fundamental Gear and Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-fitness-tracker-showdown-how-xiaomis-mi-smart-band-4-stands-out-in-our-thorough-review/"><u>Affordable Fitness Tracker Showdown: How Xiaomi's Mi Smart Band 4 Stands Out in Our Thorough Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/amping-up-your-smart-speaker-choice-the-echo-dot-vs-homepod-mini-face-off/"><u>Amping Up Your Smart Speaker Choice: The Echo Dot Vs.

Yakuza: Like a Dragon takes the standard Yakuza formula and stands it on its head, moving the fighting system from real-time to turn-based and making this entry to the series feel like a true JRPG. I played Yakuza: Like a Dragon<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-pc-games-4147292" >on PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find out if these changes make this game better or worse. Should you play the new Yakuza or skip it? Read on to check out my full review of Yakuza: Like a Dragon.</p><h2 id="Setting-and-Plot-A-very-long-intro"><a href="#Setting-and-Plot-A-very-long-intro" class="headerlink" title="Setting and Plot: A very long intro"></a>Setting and Plot: A very long intro</h2><p> Yakuza: Like a Dragon places you in the shoes of Ichiban Kasuga, a young Yakuza upstart who was raised as an orphan in a Soap House by the owner and the women who worked there. Kasuga gets into a bit of trouble with a Yakuza family but is saved by Masumi Arakawa, the patriarch of the Arakawa family. Because of this, Kasuga pledges his life to Arakawa, promising to repay the debt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Mo4mMH944CddmYJTyCxtMRxK9-k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_05-e59c99ba9bd249e7a2241f532dd742dc.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> A few years later, Kasuga is asked to confess to a murder that was really committed by one of the Captains in the family. Kasuga spends 18 years in prison for the crime, which brings us to modern day. Once out of prison, Kasuga finds he no longer has a place in the family due to some serious changes that have taken place while he was away. Kasuga is shot and left for dead in the Yokohama area of Isezaki Ijincho. From there, the game opens up as you try to rebuild everything that was lost and find out what happened.</p><p> All of the aforementioned story takes place in what could be called the introductory stages of the game. The intro was incredibly slow and took around five to six hours. Finally, after the long intro, it felt like I was getting into the real meat where the world opens up. Even after the long preamble, I was still introduced to new items, concepts, and parts of the game. It felt like a lot of handholding, which was frustrating at times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_ksFqEWrm3B3MbfrBujuNtLpcXw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_03-37ca82f2a4cd42c4ad65f34e2ca63b68.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653808&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> Once things open up, the story gets going in what can only be described as a true modern-day JRPG. It has many of the common tropes of a JRPG, like a party system that allows you to manage those who fight with you, turn-based combat, and a long sweeping epic filled with plenty of side quests.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting, and deep and interesting characters.</p><p> Yakuza: Like a Dragon is clearly inspired by games like Dragon Quest. So much so that eventually, and in a truly hilarious fashion, Kasuga begins having delusions of being a hero, and makes it his life’s mission to become a hero who can save everyone around him. These delusions play out in a physical change that takes place over enemies during combat. Their eyes turn red, and their bodies change, but Kasuga is the only one who can see these changes.</p><p> Overall, the story is interesting and engaging, with excellent voice acting and deep and interesting characters. There are plenty of opportunities to get to know the people who travel with you, and you come to care about the characters and their motivations. Yakuza: Like a Dragon is story-rich, and you won’t be disappointed at the amount of content to explore.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times"><a href="#Gameplay-Fun-yet-slow-paced-at-times" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times"></a>Gameplay: Fun, yet slow-paced at times</h2><p> Gameplay in Yakuza: Like a Dragon feels incredibly polished. World exploration feels intuitive—you can run from point to point, stopping for distractions along the way, and sometimes engage in a conversation with your party during travel. Yokohama feels alive and real. There are billboards, stores, and people everywhere. You have to be careful when crossing the street, as you can suddenly get hit by a car, which seems to happen more than it should.</p><p> The map is easy to use, and there is a taxi fast-travel system. As you explore, you will find some areas off-limits, but you’ll also find some areas where your level is not high enough to access. For the most part, though, running into enemies is really fun since it throws you into combat.</p><p> The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny.</p><p> Combat is handled with a turn-based system. During the fight, you have a menu of different selections, from regular attacks and items to defending and special attacks. This is where Yakuza: Like a Dragon really shines. The game provides you with a ton of options in the fight, and many of the moves are both over the top and quite funny. For instance, you can have a homeless teammate attack with a flock of pigeons, or maybe have your bartender attack with moves from her boxing fitness class.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ZvcwNcecc79umImvw53CUJlLvIc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_02-6396bcd8866c4a479331a02e160eb890.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><p> The moves are creative and fun to use. After selecting the attack, timed button presses may increase the attack’s effectiveness or provide you with bonus damage. When you need a true power attack, you can use your phone to call PoundMates, which is a special “Summoning” move that calls in an ally to do massive damage. There are tons of PoundMates in the game, from a diaper-wearing adult man to a poisonous lobster named Nancy, and calling these special attacks is part of what makes Yakuza fun to play.</p><p> You should be able to finish the main story in around 45 to 55 hours, depending on how fast you run through it, but I highly recommend taking your time and enjoying all the wonderful diversions available.</p><p> There’s a job system, which will let you change the different abilities of your team. This lets you customize your party to fill different roles, like healer or tank. However, in Yakuza, you’ll find some rather interesting jobs. There’s gear as well, but this is pretty standard fare. You’ll encounter a ton of diversions and side quests. Some of the minigames are innovative and comical, but some are also very benign.</p><p> This<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/pc-gaming-reviews-4689600" >PC game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> plays just like it should, and the controls are top-notch. Everything just works, which is a rare feat these days. You should be able to finish the main story in around 45 to 55 hours, depending on how fast you run through it, but I highly recommend taking your time and enjoying all the wonderful diversions available.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Excellent-visuals"><a href="#Graphics-Excellent-visuals" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Excellent visuals"></a>Graphics: Excellent visuals</h2><p> The graphics and visuals are impressive. Details are accurate and in the right places. Food looks so realistic (and delicious), and there were some moments where I could even see the pores on a person’s skin during cinematics.</p><p> During combat, there are graphical flourishes to keep the eyes excited, including damage feedback and hit animations. The city looks amazing, with realistic billboards and action.</p><p> During combat, there are graphical flourishes to keep the eyes excited, including damage feedback and hit animations.</p><p> The game ran at a smooth 60fps (I played at<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837" >1080p resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), and rarely did I come across any graphical issues or bugs. The whole game has a very modern feel but also has so many nods to its JRPG roots. Things are both rooted in reality while also being completely over the top at times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zrV5S3jL3_76G0PVgT1K_Ty6WWI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Yakuza_LikeADragon_04-e33b82262b344fecae27d668b3c92ba9-55ba8acb6d324eed81fbf5453e770db8.jpg"                      alt="Yakuza: Like a Dragon"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-The-typical-60"><a href="#Price-The-typical-60" class="headerlink" title="Price: The typical $60"></a>Price: The typical $60</h2><p> The base version of Yakuza: Like a Dragon comes in at $60 like most new titles. The price is reasonable for the amount of gameplay. However, you have two other purchase options as well. The Hero Edition, which costs $70, includes the Job Set and the Management Mode set and features two extra jobs and three sets of Management mode employees.</p><p> The Legendary Hero edition costs $90, and it includes both previously listed sets, as well as the Crafting Mat, Stat Boost, Karaoke, and Ultimate Costume sets. These are all nice bonuses and can certainly add to the experience, but you will also find more than enough gameplay in the base game.</p><h2 id="Yakuza-Like-a-Dragon-vs-Dragon-Quest-Series"><a href="#Yakuza-Like-a-Dragon-vs-Dragon-Quest-Series" class="headerlink" title="Yakuza: Like a Dragon vs. Dragon Quest Series"></a>Yakuza: Like a Dragon vs. Dragon Quest Series</h2><p> It’s clear Yakuza: Like a Dragon draws some inspiration from the recent Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest XI. Both games feature turn-based combat, jobs working as roles, and a large sweeping and epic tale. Yakuza: Like a Dragon diverges in one major way, and that is not being afraid to innovate and push the limits of what a JRPG can be. Where Dragon Quest is the basic formula, Yakuza: Like a Dragon is what happens when a mad scientist gets a hold of that formula and creates something both crazy and brilliant.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>An entertaining and addictive JRPG.</strong></p><p> A well-crafted masterpiece. Yakuza: Like a Dragon falls into the must-play category for anyone who loves a good story, JRPGs, or a wild game that will make you laugh. It’s definitely a departure from the rest of the series, but that contributes to a lot of the fun and uniqueness of the game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cyberpunk-2077-review-5113844" >Cyberpunk 2077 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/godfall-review-5095668" >Godfall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/torment-tides-of-numenera-review-5077302" >Torment: Tides of Numenera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Yakuza: Like a Dragon</li><li>Product Brand  SEGA</li><li>SKU  6413107</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  4.1 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  0.6 x 5.4 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Color  N&#x2F;A</li><li>Rating  Mature 17+</li><li>Platform  Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PS4, PS5, and PC</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-introduction-to-professional-audio-recording-a-mac-and-audacity-approach/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Introduction to Professional Audio Recording  A Mac & Audacity Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleashing-creativity-with-pro-gopro-guidance/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unleashing Creativity with Pro-GoPro Guidance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-crafty-laughter-your-adobe-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Crafty Laughter  Your Adobe Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-digital-entertainment-preservation-online-tv-show-recording-101-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Digital Entertainment Preservation  Online TV Show Recording 101 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-notable-industry-players-driving-vr-growth/"><u>[Updated] Notable Industry Players Driving VR Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-new-horizons-in-photography-lg-360-camera-update/"><u>2024 Approved  New Horizons in Photography -

The downside of this arrangement is that they usually charge you a monthly equipment rental fee which might seem small on paper but adds up over time. The Motorola MG7700 is a modem and router combo that can put your ISP’s unit to shame with four gigabit-capable LAN ports, dual-band Wi-Fi, and user-friendly setup.</p><p> We recently reviewed the MG7700 to examine just how well it would perform in an average home environment by evaluating the design, ease of setup, network speeds, and software features.</p><h2 id="Design-Simple-and-functional"><a href="#Design-Simple-and-functional" class="headerlink" title="Design: Simple and functional"></a>Design: Simple and functional</h2><p> The Motorola MG7700 is fairly compact at 9.1 x 2.6 x 2.6 inches with a gray finish and a black stand. On the front of the device, you’ll find several indicator lights that tell you if it’s powered up, whether any traffic is flowing through your network, and if people are connected to your wireless network. The light indicators are easy to see and understand — something you don’t typically find in a modem from your cable company.</p><p> The MG7700 has a power port on the back, as well as a coaxial port for connecting your service provider’s cable to the device. There are also four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-lan-4684071" >local area network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (LAN) ports if you want to directly plug your computers and other devices into the modem using an Ethernet cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/djrbmUe-WrBQ_Tx-xD6258JjBmU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-4-5c8faefcc9e77c0001a926be.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> Oddly, there’s a black area between the power port and the top LAN port that has nothing in it, as if there are LAN ports missing. With more devices like smart home hubs requiring you to plug in with Ethernet, it would have been nice to see a few more LAN ports on the back.</p><p> One thing you’ll want to keep in mind that the modem’s stand makes the nine-inch box best suited for vertical placement. You can still place it on the side but it makes for a rather untidy appearance.</p><p> The Best Cable Modems on the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Location-location-location"><a href="#Setup-Process-Location-location-location" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Location, location, location"></a>Setup Process: Location, location, location</h2><p> Since the Motorola MG7700 is a combined cable modem and router, you’ll need to plug it into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-network-cables-817868" >your ISP’s coaxial cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to pipe Internet into your home. This can limit your placement locations a bit since coax cables are often installed by your provider in less-than-ideal locations, especially if you live in an apartment building.</p><p> The router offered a strong Wi-Fi signal on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands on both floors of our home.</p><p> If you do get the choice of where it’s installed, you usually want the coax cable to come in from an unobtrusive corner, not sprouting out from the middle of the living room in an unsightly fashion. Unfortunately, that’s bad for routers which work best in a central location of your house or apartment so the signal covers everywhere you need. If you can’t get find a good spot away from other wireless devices, metal, walls, and other barriers that can impede signal, you may want to invest in a coax cable extension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RfuGGYo_UZvzWOQw8Rb7KZnMkhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-1-5c8faf2dc9e77c00014a9db2.jpg"                      alt="Motorola 7700"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> A last but vital thing to know: Motorola’s branding for the device makes clear that it’s designed for Comcast Xfinity, Cox, and Spectrum. If you don’t use one of those ISP carriers, your modem won’t work on the network.</p><p> Information about approved third-party equipment can usually be found on your cable provider’s website. If not, it’s best to call and ask before you buy. We were able to set it up on Spectrum without any trouble.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-The-latest-standards"><a href="#Connectivity-The-latest-standards" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: The latest standards"></a>Connectivity: The latest standards</h2><p> The Motorola MG7700 is a 24x8 DOCSIS 3.0 modem that doubles as a wireless router. It has 24 downstream channels (which are lanes that handle network traffic, so the more, the better) allowing it to potentially hit a 1 Gbps download speed. There are eight upstream channels for a maximum 246 Mbps upload. This is a pretty standard set of connectivity protocols that makes it a lot faster than 16x4 modems, but slower than 32x8 ones.</p><p> And while actual speeds will depend heavily on what your cable provider offers, we tested the modem on Spectrum’s 100 Mbps plan, so although the MG7700 may be advertised to be capable of 1 Gbps download, we never actually hit it. In fact, Motorola cautions that the device is realistically recommended for actual downstream service of 650 Mbps. But since relatively few people are taking advantage of gigabit Internet today (unless you’re gaming, probably), the 24x8 should serve fine for the vast majority of users.</p><p> We found that it delivered outstanding speeds, maxing out our 100Mbps Spectrum plan when hard-wired via the LAN ports.</p><p> As for the router, it’s AC1900. The “AC” means it has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> support, allowing it to beam wireless signals over two frequencies: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. The 2.4GHz band is slower but has a longer range, while the 5GHz band is faster and less prone to interference from other wireless devices compared with the 2.4GHz band, but this comes at the cost of shorter range. These days, most devices support dual-band Wi-Fi and you can select which band you want to connect to.</p><p> Some advice: It’s often best to connect things such as smart switches and smart bulbs to the 2.4GHz band since they tend to be scattered across the house and reserve the 5GHz one for more bandwidth-hungry devices such as streaming sticks, game consoles, and TVs.</p><p> The “1900” represents the maximum theoretical bandwidth the router is capable of. In this case, the MG7700 could hit 1,900 Mbps, but again, this is only if your cable provider supports it, not to mention other factors like wireless interference due to congested bands and throttling from your provider.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-with-a-caveat"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-speeds-with-a-caveat" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast speeds with a caveat"></a>Network Performance: Fast speeds with a caveat</h2><p> Once we got the modem up and running, it delivered outstanding speeds, reliably maxing out our 100 Mbps Spectrum plan when we were hard-wired via the LAN ports.</p><p> When we went wireless, performance varied greatly. As mentioned before, you’ll want to try to place the modem in an area where you can reach the greatest number of devices around your home. But, if like us, you were forced to put the router in an area that isn’t ideal because of coax cable limitations, your wireless signal won’t go as far as you might like.</p><p> Overall, if you live in a large apartment or a modestly-sized home, you won’t be disappointed by the performance of the MG7700.</p><p> We tested the Motorola MG7700 in our 4,500-square-foot home while connected to a couple dozen devices (tablets, gaming consoles, computers, smartphones, etc.). The router offered a strong Wi-Fi signal on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands on both floors of our home. Everything from surfing the Web to streaming video was solid within an approximate 2,000-square-foot radius. In the basement and more distant locations of the house, the signal was weak, but that’s to be expected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pHbG256tJv_ubRtv-HdKUka66IA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4082541-3-3-5c8fb059c9e77c0001a926bf.jpg"                      alt="Motorola MG7700"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Claire Cohen</p><p> If you have a large home like us and need stronger, more reliable speeds for numerous devices, some routers come with tri-band instead of the dual-band technology you’ll find in the MG7700. These routers have an extra 5GHz band which translates to faster speeds, more bandwidth, and the ability to connect more devices at the same time. You can also purchase a Wi-Fi extender, so your signal can extend and reach all the dead areas, but those are sometimes finicky to set up.</p><p> Overall, if you live in a large apartment or a modestly-sized home, you won’t be disappointed by the performance of the MG7700.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-User-friendly-options"><a href="#Software-User-friendly-options" class="headerlink" title="Software: User-friendly options"></a>Software: User-friendly options</h2><p> The MG7700’s built-in software is customizable, too.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> You can tell Microsoft put a considerable amount of thought into the Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard’s design. From the manta ray style folds, which keep shoulders and hands at a relaxed, comfortable angle, to the detached numpad and magnetized risers for increased customization options when you want them, the Sculpt is quite the package. As with anything new, it took a period of adjustment, but we found it relatively quick thanks to the intuitive, easy-to-use design.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Made-for-comfort"><a href="#Design-Made-for-comfort" class="headerlink" title="Design: Made for comfort"></a><strong>Design: Made for comfort</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt is an ergonomic keyboard with a split design akin to that of a manta ray. The two halves of the keyboard sweep outwards and downwards creating an empty, raised space in the center of its swoop design. Its keys vary in size, with those nearest to the split being slightly wider than those on the outer edges of the keyboard. It’s largely made with plastic and has a bit of a clacky sound as you type. The Sculpt employs a standard layout with a fabric wrist pad at the front for extra comfort. This intuitive, split design combined with the wrist pad help your wrists, hands, and shoulders sit at a neutral, natural angle in order to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >alleviate repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that frequent typists are prone to over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Cgdvz2K5QV0PheSGAjQNXTdhKP4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_02-e457e23b0c0848dbaad1197549efcc47.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> One unique feature of the Sculpt we loved was the function switch. Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key. Options include refreshing the active page, navigating to the home page in web, opening up the computer’s settings, a play&#x2F;pause button, switching between active windows, and increasing or decreasing volume.</p><p> Located on the upper-right hand side of the keyboard, this switch allows you to toggle the functionality of the top row keys, replacing the function key.</p><p> Often, keyboards include a next track or previous track multimedia feature, which the Sculpt was decidedly lacking. This was a disappointment, but otherwise, the functions are good inclusions and easy to use. If this extra functionality isn’t your thing, you simply flip this switch to the gray position and these F1-F12 keys retain their standard functionality.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Batteries-required"><a href="#Setup-Process-Batteries-required" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Batteries required"></a><strong>Setup Process: Batteries required</strong></h2><p> The Microsoft Sculpt arrives in a box with the Sculpt itself, a detached numpad, a setup guide, a registration number, and a product guide. Microsoft provides a magnetic riser that can attach to the bottom of the wrist pad as an additional setup option. It also includes a warning packet on lithium batteries since the detached numpad is powered by a 3V lithium CR2430 battery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MTaN1qUX3urJwcwQ_tv5g532Af4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_03-ec82ba429b58431eabefb1f147f474b9.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> Setting the Microsoft Sculpt up is simple. Simply lift the lid off of the battery compartment on the backside of the unit and remove the slip of paper that separates the two AAA batteries. Then, take the provided dongle from the compartment and attach it to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your PC. If you’re planning on using the detached numpad, don’t forget to also remove the slip of paper from its backside to active it. Then the Sculpt is ready for use.</p><h2 id="Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#Battery-and-Features-Backlighting-missing-and-just-one-dongle-to-rule-them-all" class="headerlink" title="Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all"></a><strong>Battery and Features: Backlighting missing, and just one dongle to rule them all</strong></h2><p> Backlighting—we love it, but the Sculpt doesn’t have it. This is, in large part, thanks to its battery-powered design. It wouldn’t make a great deal of sense for the Sculpt to have backlighting since the two AAA<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-aa-and-aaa-rechargeable-batteries-4134295" >alkaline batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would drain significantly faster, but we sure did miss it. It’s important to note that our love of backlighting is also a matter of personal preference. If it’s important to you, you might want to consider a different model. If you can live without it, the Sculpt still has a lot to offer.</p><p> Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design make this keyboard a surefire winner.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind. This is thanks to the AES 128-bit encryption technology the Sculpt uses to keep your keystrokes safe. Associated to the keyboard at the factory, there simply is no replacing it if it’s lost. While the Sculpt isn’t really travel-friendly due to its size, it would do best in an environment where it’s set up once and stays put so as to prevent losing this important piece of tech.</p><h2 id="Price-Great-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Great-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for the features"></a><strong>Price: Great for the features</strong></h2><p> Ergonomic keyboards tend to cost anywhere from $50-$200. Generally retailing for around $90 on Amazon or $129.95 MSRP, the Sculpt sits in the middle. Its features are nice for the price, too. Encrypted keystrokes, wireless technology, a detached numpad, a magnetic riser, and an ergonomic design with a wrist pad for extra comfort makes this keyboard surefire winner in our books.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BarmRhIEQlGkF0UEDLP9peOh3co=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Microsoft_ErgoKeyboards_5LW4147386_05-646724c396184c12836f3f2ce2ced675.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard vs. Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> The Sculpt’s main competition is the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard. It’s a split-style ergonomic keyboard that connects wirelessly to a PC. Instead of using plastic materials, the Surface has a higher quality build that is not only more comfortable but slightly more sound-absorbent as well. And, better yet, the Surface uses the fan-favorite Alcantara fabric, an Italian material with a suede-like feel to it, as part of its wrist pad which makes it incredibly comfortable. Its numpad is attached, however, and it doesn’t include a magnetic riser. If you prefer your wrist sitting at a raised, more neutral angle, or if you like the idea of a detached numpad, the Sculpt is the clear winner here.</p><p> One major drawback to the Sculpt’s design is the dongle that associates the keyboard to your PC is one of a kind.</p><p> Another major difference between them is the Surface doesn’t have a unique dongle associated with it at the factory.

The Surface tends to retail for around $129, much more than the Sculpt which retails for around $80. That said, it’s an upgrade in almost every way.

The Anker PowerDrive 2 is one of the most popular chargers on the market, and it didn’t disappoint during our testing. In addition to its durable plastic construction, it includes a 3-foot micro<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-micro-usb-cables-4178845" >USB cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a dual-port design, and fast recharge rates for your devices thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology.

If you yank a USB cable out of the charger haphazardly, the charger might come apart (we encountered this with the RAVPower 24W USB charger). Not so with the Anker PowerDrive 2 which survived weeks of rigorous testing and careless USB cable unpluggings. It’s also fairly compact. It’ll protrude a bit from the 12V port, but it’s not very noticeable.</p><p> Don’t let the diminutive blue LED light fool you, the Anker PowerDrive 2 can put out enough power to recharge two iPads simultaneously.</p><p> That said, it’s not the prettiest charger. The black plastic construction is fine to look at and blends in nicely with most car interiors, but the red ring around the face makes it look a bit cheap. So, too, does the “IQ” logo printed between the two USB ports, but these are fairly minor quibbles. The PowerDrive 2 has a small and unobtrusive LED light to help you find the USB ports in the dark. We found it less distracting than other chargers we tested.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.

It has the ability to charge iPads simultaneously without getting overheated thanks to its PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology. Each USB port can output a maximum 5V&#x2F;2.4A, for a total of 24W. That’s in line with other car<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-phone-chargers-4138571" >chargers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we tested, but the PowerIQ technology can help identify device and deliver the fastest possible charge. This also gives you some overvoltage protection to make sure something like a smartwatch doesn’t fry when you plug it in.</p><p> This isn’t quite the same as Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 or other fast charge technologies which vary the voltage and amperage on a larger range, but it’ll top up your phone or other devices faster than a regular charger.</p><p> The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</p><p> One thing to note is that the PowerDrive 2 includes a micro USB cable, in case you don’t want to carry your device’s cable everywhere with you. That’s a nice touch we didn’t get with other chargers we tested.</p><h2 id="Price-Middle-of-the-pack"><a href="#Price-Middle-of-the-pack" class="headerlink" title="Price: Middle of the pack"></a><strong>Price: Middle of the pack</strong></h2><p> The list price of $14.99 is positioned in the mid-range of the USB charger market, which ranges from just a few dollars to upwards of $50 for some fancier chargers. However, Anker PowerDrive 2 can be had for a discounted price on some websites. Considering the fact that the Anker PowerDrive 2 includes both the fast-charger and a 3-foot micro USB cable, it is well priced for the marketplace.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Nick Jaynes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-A-handful-of-rivals"><a href="#Competition-A-handful-of-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Competition: A handful of rivals"></a><strong>Competition: A handful of rivals</strong></h2><p> The RAVPower 24W charger is one of Anker’s main rivals. It has a metal exterior, a lower price tag, and theoretically identical power output. However, its construction is far less robust. In fact, its metal outside easily separates from the internal components easily making Anker a better pick for longevity.</p><p> The Aukey CC-S1 charger is a much closer competitor. It has the standard dual 2.4A USB ports, is constructed from plastic, and costs a few dollars less. One advantage it has is that unlike the PowerDrive, the CC-S1 sits virtually flush to the 12V socket. But you don’t get LED lights, which might make it a hindrance to find at night.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ravpower-24w-usb-car-charger-review-4686799" >RAVPower 24W USB Car Charger Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Anker PowerDrive 2 is the workhorse of the in-car USB charger market.</strong></p><p> The price is fair, the charging is fast, and the design is unobtrusive.

It’s nice, bright, and can be read both in direct sunlight and on dark nights. It displays pressure in PSI (pounds per square inch), BAR (atmospheric pressure), and kPA (kilopascal). If you’re going to use this pump mainly with American cars, you might never use units other than PSI, but it’s very convenient if you ever need to measure pressure in metric or SI (International System of Units).</p><p> The digital LCD is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump.</p><p> The maximum PSI of this portable tire inflator is 90 PSI. This is more than enough to inflate your car tires, sports equipment, and anything else you need. Most car and truck tires have a recommended PSI between 30 and 32 PSI. The Kensun will get the job done, but other car air compressors we tested can reach a maximum of up to 150 PSI.</p><p> This car tire inflator only has a 21-inch air-hose. So you’ll need to place it less than two feet away from the tire you want to inflate. The 10.9-foot power cord gives you some range, but a good deal of it will be running from your dashboard and out your car window. This is about the same hose length you can expect similar products, but it pales in comparison to the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which has a 16-foot air hose.</p><p> The integrated flashlight on the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is pretty bright and illuminates the pump’s working area well. This also makes it more visible to passing cars if you happened to be filling up on the side of the road late at night.</p><p> One of the more annoying aspects of this portable air compressor is how it stores its cords while not in use. Both the air-hose and 12V adapter cord share one big compartment in the bottom of the pump. This would be fine if there was a clear way to fit them in there. When we received our test unit, we were surprised to see that it looked like the power cord was jammed in with no cable management at all.</p><p> When you do finally get it wrapped up, the pump fits nicely in its included carrying case. It’s made of gore-tex, a fairly durable material, so it can take the punishment of being stored long-term in your trunk, and it’s compact enough that it won’t take up much room.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute"><a href="#Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: T-minus one minute"></a><strong>Setup Process: T-minus one minute</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve read the user manual, you’ll know how to use the Kensun portable tire inflator. Nevertheless, you’ll want to do some test runs before you take it on the road. During our testing phase, we timed how long it takes from getting out of the car to the pump inflating one of our tires. It took about one minute, which is good time if you’re on the side of the highway with an unexpected flat.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud</strong></h2><p> When we tested the tire inflator, we took it on a road trip that took us to the states of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Along the way, we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations. In order to use them in the circumstances, they were designed for. Throughout it all, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator never failed to work when we needed it.</p><p> We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> We deflated all four tires on our 2014 Kia Rio to 20 PSI—the recommended PSI for that model is 32 PSI, meaning 20 PSI was dangerously low to drive on. We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> This is a bit longer than the average fill time of the other models we tested like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor pump, which consistently filled our tires in under a minute.</p><p> Any portable tire inflator you use will generate a good deal of noise. Using a decibel meter, we measured how loud this compressor gets while it’s in use. The highest level we recorded was 90 decibels, but it usually hovered at about 88 decibels. That’s not loud enough to damage your hearing, but you’ll have to step away if you want to take a phone call.</p><p> The accuracy was the best of all the air compressors we tested. We compared the air pressure on the digital display with that of a plain pencil-style tire pressure gauge. We found that it was consistently accurate to within a 5 PSI range. Four times more accurate than the 2 PSI range we observed on some other inflators.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long. However, if you’re using it to inflate multiple objects or larger items, you’ll have to take a periodic break while it cools down.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long.</p><p> One of the most convenient things about this portable air pump is its auto-shutdown feature. This allows you to select the precise tire pressure you want before you start pumping. Once the tire is inflated to the desired pressure, it shuts down. This means that you don’t have to babysit the pump while it’s going, and all but guarantees that you won’t over-inflate your tires.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility"><a href="#Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility" class="headerlink" title="Price: A decent buy considering its versatility"></a><strong>Price: A decent buy considering its versatility</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator has an MSRP of $80 on Amazon, which is a good price for what you get. It’s not nearly as affordable as some budget models we’ve seen, such as the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump, which will only run you $40, but it gives you the convenience of not having to be tethered to your car to inflate something.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is similar to the Jaco Digital Tire Inflator, they have similar cord and hose lengths, and can continually run for about half an hour. But the Kensun is more than twice the size of the Jaco, so it can deliver more power to fill your tires faster. Additionally, the Jaco lacks the ability to plug into an AC socket, so you can only use it in your car.</p><p> But the Jaco does offer some benefits the Kensun doesn’t. Its built-in light is just as bright as the Kensun’s, but it also has the ability to flash hazard signals for oncoming traffic, and even put out an SOS in Morse Code in the event of real emergencies. Plus, its small form factor makes it much easier to put away and store.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jaco-smartpro-digital-tire-inflator-review-4776811" >Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A portable tire inflator that can work well in a car or at home.</strong></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a great choice to keep in your truck, garage, or wherever you keep your “just-in-case” supplies. It’s a device that is as necessary for drivers as jumper cables and an emergency flashlight. You can count on it to be reliable when you need it, and fill your tires quickly and accurately. Plus, the added benefit of being able to plug it into your wall can’t be overstated. It has its foibles, but in the grand scheme of things, they’re minor inconveniences.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729507&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/TIU/Nero_TuneItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                >&#x2F;a&gt;</p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  AC&#x2F;DC Portable Air Pump Tire Inflator</li><li>Product Brand  Kensun</li><li>Price  $79.99</li><li>Release Date  July 2016</li><li>Weight  5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.8 x 4.3 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 Years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/n-2024-essential-steps-for-starting-a-youtube-channel/"><u>[New] In 2024, Essential Steps for Starting a YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-champion-phonographs-for-seminar-sessions/"><u>[Updated] Champion Phonographs for Seminar Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-peering-into-the-future-of-video-capturing-with-apeaksoft/"><u>[Updated] Peering Into the Future of Video Capturing with Apeaksoft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-recover-missing-audio-from-tweeted-videos/"><u>[Updated] Recover Missing Audio From Tweeted Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/1715860715344-updated-the-compre-written-documentation-and-examples-for-recording-sims-4-games-in-a-way-that-is-clear-concise-and-easy-to-understand-with-each-new-title-c/"><u>[Updated] The Compre Written Documentation and Examples for Recording Sims 4 Games in a Way that Is Clear, Concise, and Easy to Understand, with Each New Title Conveying Similar Meanings While Adhering to the Maximum Character Limit of 156 Characters.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-top-picks-for-affordable-cloud-data-management/"><u>[Updated] Top Picks for Affordable Cloud Data Management</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-transform-ordinary-unboxings-into-viral-phenomena-on-insta-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Transform Ordinary Unboxings Into Viral Phenomena on Insta for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/advanced-obs-setup-for-skype-screenshots-for-2024/"><u>Advanced OBS Setup for Skype Screenshots for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/1723008221851-affordable-quality-with-arcshell-ar-5-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>Affordable Quality with Arcshell AR-5 - A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-itel-a60-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Android Unlock Code Sim Unlock Your Itel A60 Phone and Remove Locked Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/best-anti-virus-programs-for-your-iphone-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Best Anti-Virus Programs for Your iPhone – A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/bridging-gaps-using-samsung-flow-for-device-synergy/"><u>Bridging Gaps: Using Samsung Flow for Device Synergy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-meets-quality-in-the-apeman-c450-review-smart-choice-for-frugal-car-cameras/"><u>Budget Meets Quality in the Apeman C450 Review: Smart Choice for Frugal Car Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-or-see-text-messages-what-can-you-do-with-life360-on-poco-m6-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages?

Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender takes on a different kind of philosophy. That’s reflected in the boosted price, certainly, but also the capabilities: this is the first Wi-Fi 6 extender on the market.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a new standard that not only allows for faster maximum speeds than previous generations but also better accommodates the increasing pile of wireless devices that we have around our homes and connecting at any given time—from phones to laptops and smart home gadgets. Newer smartphones and laptops are implementing support for the standard, and new Wi-Fi routers are being released to supply those benefits.</p><p> If you don’t already have one of those new Wi-Fi 6 routers, should you spend extra for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 to futureproof your setup? Here’s what I think after testing the device for several days across everyday web usage, media streaming, playing online games, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Pretty-awkward"><a href="#Design-Pretty-awkward" class="headerlink" title="Design: Pretty awkward"></a><strong>Design: Pretty awkward</strong></h2><p> The Netgear’s Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is not only the largest and heaviest Wi-Fi extender I’ve tested at 10 inches tall and nearly two pounds, but it’s also one of the oddest-looking. It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward. Also, the little plastic feet don’t do a great job of supporting the weight, making it a bit wobbly on a flat surface.</p><p> With very large sides, the front is really just a small panel with light-up LED indicators showing connectivity details and which Ethernet ports are in use. There’s also a small WPS button beneath the LED panel for easy connectivity with a router. On the wider back panel are the four wired<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for plugging in devices such as game consoles and computers, as well as a USB 3.0 port, DC power port, and the power button itself.</p><p> It has a lot more angles and tapered elements than I’d think are necessary, which results in an overall look that’s dynamic but ultimately awkward.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Avoid-the-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Avoid the app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Avoid the app</strong></h2><p> The setup options for the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 are the same as with Netgear’s other extenders—even those without Wi-Fi 6 support. You’ll begin with the extender plugged in near your router. If your router supports<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you can pair the extender with it easily by following the process listed in the included booklet, which is as simple as pressing a button on the router and then doing the same on the extender.</p><p> If that’s not an option, or you’d rather follow a step-by-step process with prompts, then you can set it up using either a mobile (iOS or Android) app or a web browser on your computer.</p><p> The mobile app has been unreliable in my experience with other Netgear extenders, but it was much worse when setting up the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The app repeatedly could not connect with the created mesh network on the extender during setup, and I had to factory reset the device multiple times to start again.</p><p> Over and over, the setup process wouldn’t complete… and then it finally did. I ran into similar issues with the other Netgear extenders, in which setup processes didn’t work as expected on the first or second time, but this was a much longer and more arduous ordeal. Finally, however, I got the Nighthawk AX8 up and running. From there, you’ll need to find a new location for the extender—roughly halfway between the router and your Wi-Fi dead zone is ideal, but play around with positioning if you’re not getting the results you seek.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xru8JLL_UOk3sXBYpbrOyAl-ihc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_02-b120eab8816746338c53e4eb1cfc62d6.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872496/14483" target="_top" id="1872496"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872496"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="625"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872496/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Smooth-sailing"><a href="#Connectivity-Smooth-sailing" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Smooth sailing"></a><strong>Connectivity: Smooth sailing</strong></h2><p> Once through the hassle of setup, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender really did deliver strong performance. I tested the connection in my office, which reliably sees reduced 5GHz reception from my router due to obstructions in between, and saw a noticeable boost in both reception and speed.</p><p> In one test, I registered a 5GHz speed of 246Mbps with the extender, which was the fastest wireless speed I’ve seen anywhere in my house using that older, TP-Link router. Given that, I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8. The router isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, but I still saw higher top-end speeds than ever before.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender also performed pretty well in distance testing. In another instance, I registered a 5GHz download speed of 87Mbps with my office, and then measured the speeds from my backyard at approximate distance intervals from the extender.</p><p> I wasn’t prepared for the blistering 406Mbps speed registered by my laptop when plugged into one of the Ethernet ports on the back of the Netgear Nighthawk AX8.</p><p> That 5GHz signal dropped down to 77Mbps at 25 feet, 74Mbps at 50 feet, and 56Mbps at 25 feet—still pretty speedy from the farthest edge of my property. Meanwhile, the 2.4GHz signal started at just 42Mbps at that moment in my office, and dropped to 30Mbps at 25 feet, 28Mbps at 50 feet, and 26Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Given the high max speeds, it wasn’t surprising to see strong gaming performance, as well. While playing Rocket League, I saw smooth gameplay across the wired Ethernet connection as well as both wireless networks, with a ping as low as 33 via the wired connection. The wireless ping was only a few points higher.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rtnI3hSe9qP5qFqjhu1LRxe7qYY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkEAX80_03-19da5fea4d0349ce984f52a11493d337.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 (EAX80) Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p> As a Wi-Fi mesh extender, the Netgear Nighthawk AX8 will automatically replicate the SSID of your router’s existing Wi-Fi networks and seamlessly keep you connected whenever you’re in range of either. That’s true even with non-Netgear routers and those without Wi-Fi 6 support, and it’s a huge benefit over some cheaper extenders that don’t keep the same network info intact across devices.</p><p> It’s billed as an “8-stream” device, so it should be able to handle several simultaneous media streams at once, with a billed max speed of 4.8Gbps on the 5GHz band and 1.2Gbps on the 2.4GHz band. It has<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple users, multi-in multi-out) and beamforming capabilities, promising expanded range of up to 2,500 square feet and support for 30+ simultaneous devices.</p><p> If you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi mesh system instead.</p><h2 id="Price-More-than-most"><a href="#Price-More-than-most" class="headerlink" title="Price: More than most"></a><strong>Price: More than most</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk AX8 Wi-Fi 6 Mesh Extender is listed at $250, although it’s being sold for $220 at multiple retailers as of this writing. That’s definitely on the higher end for an extender.</p><p> Should you really spend that much on an extender? If you don’t already have a new Wi-Fi 6 router, then probably not. You might see higher peaks of speed as I did, but rather than trying to mix and match old and new tech, you’re probably better off investing in a new Wi-Fi mesh system that can cover the entire house. Netgear’s Orbi is a favorite, as is Google’s similar Nest Wi-Fi system.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BSysTools%2BOutlook%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/outlook-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-AX8-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-X6S-EX8000" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk AX8 vs. Netgear Nighthawk X6S (EX8000)</strong></h2><p> Both of these Netgear Nighthawk Wi-Fi extenders will set you back $200 or more, and the key difference between them—aside from design—is the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility of the Nighthawk AX8. The Nighthawk X6S (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Wi-Fi-Range-Extender-EX8000/dp/B074F3M2W8/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846125%7Cn35b11b2c61b54fa1a2d951691d1a61ed04%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have that, but it does deliver excellent 5GHz range and has four Gigabit Ethernet ports for wired devices. The Nighthawk AX8 is more future-proof as a result, but at a greater cost that becomes increasingly difficult to justify the higher, it climbs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Only for early adopters with Wi-Fi 6 routers and devices.</strong></p><p> If you’ve already bought a Wi-Fi 6 router and need a little help extending your signal into further corners of your home and&#x2F;or property, then the Nighthawk AX 8 (EAX 80) is the extender you’ll want. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi 6 router, then you’ll either want to start there or consider investing in a Wi-Fi<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178" >mesh system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Spending more than $200 on an extender doesn’t make much sense unless you’re adding it to a top-of-the-line system—and don’t mind the significant investment.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs"

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you have a growing family or a growing list of devices competing for bandwidth in your home, you’ve probably experienced jockeying for a signal here or there. That’s where a capable tri-band router like the Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router comes in handy. This router boasts high-speed Wi-Fi of up to 3.2Gbps and three different Wi-Fi bands that work simultaneously to deliver the connectivity all your family members and devices require.</p><p> We used this tri-band router and observed various aspects starting with the setup process, software ease of use, and performance power when performing typical streaming and browsing activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/q6eQHVPL_nzfI20_HhRY5seg85c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-3-3baf530c5df54c9c903579053d19c25c.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851691&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Pro - Software based live production. vMix Pro includes everything in vMix 4K plus 8 channels of Replay and 8 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-little-flashy"><a href="#Design-A-little-flashy" class="headerlink" title="Design: A little flashy"></a><strong>Design: A little flashy</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk X6 router is aptly named for its six antennas that are fixed to both sides of the face of the device. While you can easily fold these antennas flat, for easy moving to and from one spot to another, you’ll need to place them upright in order to maximize the signal strength.</p><p> Aside from the unique antenna design, all the indicator lights are also presented in a sort of stylish way right down the middle of the router. All the lights flash white and the Wi-Fi on&#x2F;off and WPS buttons are set off on their own at the bottom with triangular buttons. The main body of the router is box-like in shape and skews larger with dimensions of 11.63 x 8.92 x 2.14 inches (HWD). Some shoppers may like the aeronautic design of the router, inspired by the Nighthawk stealth fighter plane, which also looks somewhat futuristic.

There is a sticker on top of the router with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the app can use to detect the router and launches a quick setup process, but we couldn’t get this code to register. Instead, we went to the App Store and manually downloaded the mobile app.</p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices.</p><p> The first thing we had to do when we launched the Nighthawk app was to create a Netgear account. Then we chose the “New Setup” option and were directed to reboot our modem and then attach the provided Ethernet cable into the router and our modem. Almost instantly we were able to connect to the default network using the credentials the manufacturer provided. We returned to the app to set up another line of defense to the router admin login credentials with security questions and customize our system network and password.</p><p> After these changes, we had to reconnect to the network which went off without a hitch. We further chose to apply the firmware update that was recommended. That took several minutes and also required rebooting the router. At this point, we noticed that the second 5GHz connection was lost. After several attempts to make things right by resetting the router and the modem and router, the only step that resolved it was a factory reset. We suspect this could have been an issue with the firmware update, but once all of that was finally resolved we were able to connect to our 150Mbps Xfinity service on all three bands.</p><p> Overall, minus the hitch that tacked on an additional 10-15 minutes of troubleshooting, we found the guided setup to be straightforward, quick, and easy to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kHfwPJF-cpnSAITo_i4moZ2Jnw0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-4-1d3586d798cf44a9b219c9fd885069b3.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4576829&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9e740b84bb48a64dde25061566299467/products/copy_1_jp_box_big.png"                      border="0"                >Jet Profiler for MySQL, Enterprise Version： Jet Profiler for MySQL is real-time query performance and diagnostics tool for the MySQL database server.

The advantage here is that unlike older single- or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that operate on older Wi-Fi standards or even newer dual-band options functioning on the most current Wi-Fi 5 standard, there’s additional support for more devices and less competition over bandwidth.</p><p> That’s supported by beamforming technology, which is a feature all 802.11ac routers support. This technology sends targeted Wi-Fi signals to your devices rather than sending them in every direction. Ultimately, this means a stronger direct signal to your laptop, TV, or other devices, and potentially more consistent and stronger connections.</p><p> Since this router is classified as an AC3200 device, that means it has the potential to deliver up to 600Mbps (megabit per second) on the 2.4GHz spectrum and up to 1300Mbps on the 5GHz channels. This Wi-Fi speed rating doesn’t guarantee you’ll see these exact results in your home. It’s merely a number that describes the absolute potential performance power. In reality, the speeds you see will depend on the type of internet service plan you have and other environmental and network conditions that impact wireless performance.</p><p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 also comes with Dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) technology, which is another tool for managing bandwidth by allocating signals in specific directions and based on your priorities. Netgear says that users who like to game and stream video (and have combined download and upload speeds of less than 300Mbps) could garner enhanced performance by enabling this feature, which you can do from the web interface—but not the app.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fast-but-sometimes-underwhelming" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fast, but sometimes underwhelming</strong></h2><p> Using the Nighthawk app’s built-in speed test feature, which uses the Ookla SpeedTest technology, the best download speed registered at 95Mbps right after we set up the router. More typically, the output was around 88-95Mbps at varying points in the day.</p><p> We could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands.</p><p> We never experienced a completely dropped connection, but at times the 2.4GHz channel performed sluggishly with simple operations like checking email or online browsing. We connected TVs where we stream HD and 4K content and use a gaming console to the 5GHz networks and used the 2.4GHz channel for laptops, mobile devices, and a tablet. Distributing those devices across the other two bands seemed to ease some congestion, and we could consistently operate six to seven devices at once without any speed drops or major performance issues across all three bands. We also noticed a mild improvement in image clarity and loading speed of streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.</p><p> Though we were unable to test the full range of this router, we had no issues in our 1,100-square-foot space. The manufacturer does say that this device can serve very large homes and there are six antennas that help boost this coverage, but the actual range—just like speed—will depend on factors like the thickness of your walls, router placement, and interference from other signals and devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/qDgf4s6CZg8XEea_CVo6DMwg5lg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-Wi-Fi-Router-5-733eda7f890a4105b5bc94ddf8169c81.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive"><a href="#Software-User-friendly-and-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Software: User-friendly and intuitive"></a><strong>Software: User-friendly and intuitive</strong></h2><p> Everything is laid out quite cleanly in the Nighthawk app in terms of guided setup and accessing the information most users will probably be interested in—like speed information, devices connected, Wi-Fi settings, and parental controls using the Circle with Disney app to monitor everyone’s screen time and activity. The app also comes with a 30-day trial of Netgear Armor security, which does the work of detecting threats from malware, bots, and any other network vulnerabilities.</p><p> The mobile app certainly skews more toward the general user with its uncomplicated layout, but that also means less control over more technical specifications which requires using the web interface. This information isn’t necessarily hidden, but it’s only laid out in the user manual which is accessible from the Netgear site.</p><p> This router is equally friendly to the general user as well as the more tech-savvy customer.</p><p> While the Nighthawk X6 does come with built-in firewall protection, you can elevate security settings and personalize the router setup from the router’s web interface. From the web GUI’s advanced settings area, you can control access or block certain websites, set up security email notifications, establish VPN service, create a personal FTP server, or use<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-dynamic-dns-816294" >Dynamic DNS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Other features of interest through the web GUI include setting up a USB device to perform Time Machine backups for Mac laptops and using the router’s media server capabilities to play music from the iTunes server.</p><p> In this respect, the Nighthawk X6 R8000 is equally friendly to the general user who doesn’t want to delve into the technical deep end as well as the more tech-savvy customer who does.</p><h2 id="Price-A-bit-steep"><a href="#Price-A-bit-steep" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bit steep"></a><strong>Price: A bit steep</strong></h2><p> The Nighthawk X6 R8000 has a list price of $270, which certainly places it in the high-end tier of wireless routers. And while it’s not the most expensive tri-band router on the market, your decision to make this investment could come down to factors like how large your home is, how many devices you’re working with, and how fast your internet service plan is. The tri-band Wi-Fi technology is impressive, and there are many attractive features: an intuitive and low-effort app, built-in security with Netgear Armor, as well as a detailed level of control over managing how everyone in the family spends their screen time, but there are equally capable as less expensive options on the market.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X6-AC3200-vs-Asus-RT-AC3200" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 vs. Asus RT-AC3200</strong></h2><p> One of the strengths of the Nighthawk X6 R800 is how fast and simple it is to set up for even those who are tech-shy. But if you’re willing or interested in diving in deeper technically, paying less, and still obtaining impressive Wi-Fi performance, the Asus RT-AC3200 retails for $200 and overlaps with the Nighthawk X6 in a number of ways. Both feature three bands, six antennas, QoS and beamforming technologies, VPN and Time Machine support, and peace of mind with respective built-in security platforms.</p><p> The Asus router does require a little more technical know-how for managing the router via the app and web interface. Another factor that may influence whether you think this trade-off is worth it is your interest in integrating your router into a smart-home configuration. The Nighthawk X6 R8000, like many other<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-netgear-routers-4159862" >Netgear routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does allow that with Amazon Alexa compatibility whereas the Asus RT-AC3200 does not.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An investment that could be worth it for the family with a smart home.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X6 AC3200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router is poised to deliver fast and reliable speed to a larger home full of devices.

So when I saw Cities: Skylines promise a more modern take on city-building, I picked it up. Years later, I can finally redeem myself and build a modern city from the ground up thanks to this sandbox city-builder game. At first, it was rough, but in my twenty hours of gameplay, I had a fun experience.

Since it’s a sandbox city-building game, the base game’s sole goal is to allow you the freedom to build a city from scratch without any scenario restrictions. This removal of a plot is both refreshing and a curse. Two hours in, and I was having a blast building up roads and commercial areas; a couple hours later, and I could feel the itch to start a new map. There are no real scenarios, without real stakes, which later in the game presented a major problem for me.</p><p> Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order solved this issue by releasing a massive amount of expansions akin to the Sims franchise. Ranging from more simple content packs, like Modern Japan, or High-Tech Buildings, to expansions offering more features, like Sunset Harbor and Natural Disasters, scenarios become unlocked through their purchase.</p><p> Two hours in, and I was having a blast building up roads and commercial areas; a couple hours later, and I could feel the itch to start a new map.</p><p> The game’s menu will let you know which scenarios are associated with each expansion or content pack, so you’ll know what to pick up should you want a specific scenario. While I’m sure this will add hours of gameplay and offer a more challenging experience, I only tested out the base game for Cities:Skylines—though the option of natural disasters would make this pleasantville-like city-builder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/588X3UAailg5Hybxdvxqw8a_G-o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cities-Skylines_02-04c0ef53b3cf4183ae1388ed1216c2e6.jpg"                      alt="Cities: Skylines"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Tough-learning-curve"><a href="#Gameplay-Tough-learning-curve" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay :Tough learning curve"></a><strong>Gameplay</strong> :<strong>Tough learning curve</strong></h2><p> At first, I couldn’t figure out Cities: Skylines. I wanted to love the game because it was a city-builder that was solely there to act as a sandbox. As I began to play it, though, I realized I had no idea how to play this game. Sure, you could build roads as well as residential and commercial areas, but ensuring the taxes associated with these properties turn into profit turned out to be really hard for me. A few tries later, and I decided that I needed to turn to YouTube to see how to start the game.</p><p> This rough beginning is something to which I fault Paradox. Every other city-builder I’ve played starts with some kind of introduction, a way to dip your toes into the game without destroying a city homes to thousands of digital people. Cities: Skylines throws you into the experience headfirst and expects you to succeed.</p><p> Cities: Skylines throws you into the experience headfirst and expects you to succeed.</p><p> Once I got past this bump in the road, though, a modern take on city-building led me to new heights. My citizens “tweeted” to me when I forgot to put in sewer lines. They sent out social media blasts praising new parks I put in, and they also made sure you knew if there were traffic problems. In fact, I never realized how much thought one needs to put into creating traffic lanes and streets until I became mayor of my cities. As I learned quickly, a lot of thought goes into it—and one lane roads are your new best friend.</p><p> That was part of the beauty of the 20 hours I spent playing Cities: Skylines, though. Modern times means that the idea of the modern city grows, too. The game starts out with two roads: one leading into town, and one leading out of it. Thanks to amazing local traffic simulations—a quality the game does and should boast of—you’ll have to build your population up to earn the right to build those highways.</p><p> The game starts out with two roads: one leading into town, and one leading out of it. Thanks to amazing local traffic simulations—a quality the game does and should boast of—you’ll have to build your population up to earn the right to build those highways.</p><p> Along with road options, other rewards come as your population grows: parks, commercial districting, industry building, loan options, even the concept of garbage disposal. I see why they did it. I would have been that weirdo who would have spent the original amount doled out to start the city on the Statue of Liberty just because I could. As weird as it seems initially, this rewards system makes sense.</p><p> As with the roads, this game is designed to be in a constant state of construction. You’re going to want to tear out roads and rebuild them. You’ll need to decide how much funding to invest into your local education or your garbage disposal (a lot to this last one). To build up a population, maybe you’ll have to tear out that adorable residential neighborhood in favor of high rise apartments that are designed to attract younger populations.</p><p> As much as I wanted to keep that children’s playground right next to the school, building a college campus beside the high school made more sense to build up my education numbers and create high wage jobs—even if the neighborhood released sad faces into the air over the loss. It’s what makes its reasonably fast gameplay interesting, and fun. And because it’s a sandbox, you’re the one who has to make these kinds of heavy decisions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/f8EjasEAuN7d0yNI_yXkZlPz8A4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cities-Skylines_03-4df9547f975749bbb7facb80717838b7.jpg"                      alt="Cities: Skylines"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Graphics-Bright-and-colorful"><a href="#Graphics-Bright-and-colorful" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Bright and colorful"></a><strong>Graphics: Bright and colorful</strong></h2><p> I went into Cities:Skylines, fully expecting a similar experience to<a class="link"   href="https://www.gog.com/game/simcity%5F3000" >SimCity 3000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on GOG). To my surprise, the graphics were fun and colorful. You can’t alter the buildings in any way, but Paradox and Colossal Order both made sure to have an array of color into the designs. In fact, to make the graphics any fancier I feel would have been a disservice to the game. It perfectly balances necessity and glamor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ScVT0Z65L44TgSD3IYaIaWCdXLA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Cities-Skylines_04-83e9ebc98c9546dfa595e6baf45d23bf.jpg"                      alt="Cities: Skylines"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad"><a href="#Price-Not-bad" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad"></a><strong>Price: Not bad</strong></h2><p> Cities: Skylines will put you back around $30, which isn’t too bad. However, the issue I take with it being $30 is that it’s only for the base game. You won’t get the extra features of the expansions or content packs unless you can land a Steam sale. For a base game that doesn’t come with any scenarios other than the basic sandbox with a handful of maps, it’s a little frustrating. However, if you’re like me and can spend hours in sandbox games, then the price shouldn’t worry you too much.</p><p> For a base game that doesn’t come with any scenarios other than the basic sandbox with a handful of maps, it’s a little frustrating.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Other-city-builders"><a href="#Competition-Other-city-builders" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Other city-builders"></a><strong>Competition: Other city-builders</strong></h2><p> Cities: Skylines is a regular city-building game. It doesn’t come with any wild sci-fi fantasy themes, like 2018’s science-fiction city-builder<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/464920/Surviving%5FMars/" >Surviving Mars <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam). In a similar vein to Surviving Mars, though, Cities: Skylines focuses on creating a city-state from scratch. Because it lacks the multitude of scenarios Surviving Mars has to offer, you’ll ultimately have to decide which you prefer: science fiction sized dust storms on a planet just now ready for colonization, or a plain green cityscape ready to be molded into a thriving metropolis. If you want a plain city-building game, then Cities: Skylines might be more geared toward your taste.</p><p> However, 2019’s<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/492720/Tropico%5F6/" >Tropico 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view on Steam) really gives Cities: Skylines a run for its money. In Cities: Skylines you’ll never have elections in your city, and your people will be kind even as they gripe about their lack of electricity in their coffee shop. Tropico 6 does not offer that luxury. In its multitude of scenarios, you’re going to anger a lot of people—so many, in fact, that you’ll have to watch out for rebellions and build up forces to fight the capitalists. I’m not saying that it’s easy—in fact, it’s quite difficult at times to manage the factions in Tropico 6.</p><p> That’s what makes Cities: Skylines a refreshing take on the city-builder. Because it’s a sandbox city-builder, I don’t have to worry about massive complications in city-building. There are fires and crime overlay risks, but at least I don’t have to lose sleep over whether the militarists will incite rebellion. Once again, if you want a plain city-builder where you can shape the entire course of your city, then Cities: Skylines is your best bet. If you want to “arrange accidents” for communists as well as hours-long scenarios, then pick up the more expensive Tropico 6.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An addictive city-building simulation, but you’ll need the DLC to take full advantage.</strong></p><p> For the base game, Cities:Skylines offers hours of creative, fast gameplay. If you want to be challenged more, then be prepared to shell out some extra cash for its large number of expansions. For a game whose base is solely a sandbox city-builder, it’s a great way to let your creativity shine while enjoying the amenities of the modern world for your residents.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a

This heavy brick of a portable charger proves to be a handy tool, especially in the car—whether for emergencies or when you need to top up a device while you’re away from home.</p><p> Granted, it doesn’t pack as much power as some dedicated laptop chargers, which may be a better option for that need. Still, the added versatility gives the Halo Bolt a unique edge in the market. I tested the Halo Bolt for a week with multiple devices, including laptops and smartphones.</p><h2 id="Design-The-shiny-brick"><a href="#Design-The-shiny-brick" class="headerlink" title="Design: The shiny brick"></a><strong>Design: The shiny brick</strong></h2><p> While certainly portable, the Halo Bolt isn’t designed to be pocket-friendly. This big brick of a battery pack comes in at 7.2 x 1.6 x 3.8 inches (HWD) with a weight of more than 1.5 pounds. Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.</p><p> It’s made of mostly thick black plastic outside, including a glossy brushed silver top layer with an imprinted Halo logo. The front face is where most of the ports sit, including two USB-A ports (5V&#x2F;2.4A), a DC input for the charging adapter, and jump-start inputs hidden behind a small door. The right side, meanwhile, has the 115V AC&#x2F;65W max AC power plug input for laptop chargers and other plug-in devices.</p><p> Smaller, cheaper battery packs are available for smartphones, but this beast is made for heavier-duty needs and is designed accordingly.</p><p> Each set of inputs has a power button to activate the ports, and you can use the AC input and USB ports simultaneously, but the Jump Starter can only function independently. Meanwhile, the left side of the device has a bright built-in LED flashlight with a power button, giving you another handy tool during car emergencies.</p><p> The Halo Bolt also comes with an array of accessories, including a wall charging adapter, a car charging adapter, jumper cables, a USB-to-micro USB cable, and a cinching pouch for quick storage of all the above. All of the cables and accessories are a welcome bonus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nYYltjJN71EGK1Dwv2_XABixuhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-04-85b590a9939a4f44b0c7a510a456b80f.jpg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Load-it-up"><a href="#Setup-Process-Load-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Load it up"></a><strong>Setup Process: Load it up</strong></h2><p> You’ll need to charge the brick to total capacity before using it, and the four green battery lights on the right side of the front face indicate how much capacity is currently left. The battery is fully charged when all four are illuminated when pressing any of the power buttons. Otherwise, for the AC and USB ports, the Halo Bolt is a plug-and-play charger.</p><p> The whole process for jump-starting a car is detailed in the included instructions. The Halo Bolt has built-in safety features that ensure you have correctly aligned the jumper cables before starting the connected car, boat, lawnmower, or other vehicles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mUdXUjWxeupVqNR_y43_eFTC0ic=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-02-69b93dc934684ef5b71a40215f6162f2.jpg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39655089&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/wa/01_WA_728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Not-so-long-lasting" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Not so long-lasting</strong></h2><p> The Halo Bolt has 58,830mWh of battery power within, and the official description suggests that it can provide up to several hours of additional usage for a MacBook Pro or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-4688969" >iPad Air <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . In my testing, the results didn’t quite match those targets.</p><p> Plugging in a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-4770116" >mid-2019 MacBook Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge. It went from 0 percent to 88 percent in 1 hour and 30 minutes, at a maximum recorded charging rate of 58.29W (20.1V&#x2F;1.9A).</p><p> In a separate test, I played a locally-downloaded movie on loop at 100 percent brightness on the laptop, with the Halo Bolt plugged in to sustain the laptop’s fully-charged battery. The Halo Bolt provided power to the computer for 5 hours, 14 minutes before running out of battery, but that’s a fair bit less than the Mophie Powerstation AC (6 hours, 22 minutes) and ZMI PowerPort 20000 (8 hours, 4 minutes) in the same test.</p><p> Plugging in a mid-2019 MacBook Pro (13-inch) with its own AC adapter, the Halo Bolt charged it quickly but ran out of juice before the battery could fully recharge.</p><p> Not having a USB-C Power Delivery port on the Halo Bolt is disappointing, as many modern devices rely on the standard for speedy charging. You’ll need to bring your own AC adapters to plug into the AC port to get maximum speeds.</p><p> For example, charging a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-4685690" >Samsung Galaxy S10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> smartphone using one of the Halo Bolt’s USB-A ports took 2 hours and 56 minutes to complete at a paltry 5.19W (4.76V x 1.09A), starting from 0 percent. However, when I repeated the test using Samsung’s charger via the AC port, it finished in 1 hour and 34 minutes thanks to fast charging—nearly half the total time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MNFqifirQ0sn61GPO1e-bLQ1t8s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Halo-06-8bc3449bd35243aaaf67272c1d3774a6-bc803e0a114b4116adf3078af6a2de00.jpeg"                      alt="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-It’s-priced-right"><a href="#Price-It’s-priced-right" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s priced right"></a><strong>Price: It’s priced right</strong></h2><p> For a jack-of-all-trades power brick that can jump-start your car and charge its battery, serve as a bright flashlight for roadside emergencies, and charge a wide array of portable devices, the $100 price seen on Amazon looks pretty reasonable. However, given that it couldn’t charge my laptop to total capacity and lacks a USB-C port, handier, higher-capacity charging bricks are available specifically for laptop and smartphone charging needs.</p><h2 id="Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000"><a href="#Halo-Bolt-ACDC-58830-vs-ZMI-PowerPack-20000" class="headerlink" title="Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000"></a><strong>Halo Bolt ACDC 58830 vs. ZMI PowerPack 20000</strong></h2><p> Here’s a prime example. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/zmi-powerpack-20000-review-5071991" >ZMI PowerPack 20000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072BD98CM?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=5071993%7Cn35698be70c304b229c7a194255ab2d3620%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) doesn’t have an AC port. However, it’s pocket-friendly, packs a lot of capacity (20,000mAh), and can quickly recharge laptops with its included USB-C port. It also has two USB-A ports and sufficient juice to recharge the same MacBook Pro from empty. Best of all, it only costs $70.</p><p> But that smaller, cheaper power brick is only meant for portable devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and handheld game systems. It has no jump-start capabilities nor an AC port to accommodate a wider array of devices.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Final Verdict: A convenient backup battery and jump starter.</strong></p><p> The Halo Bolt isn’t the best option for charging laptops, but it is a solid all-around device for providing backup power to a broader array of gadgets, not to mention jump-starting a car. This versatile device is smart to have around if you drive a car and are frequently mobile with your portable gadgets.

The four external active antennas are chunky, evocative of their impressive power, and decked out with soothing blue LEDs.</p><p> A row of LED indicators marches across the angled front surface of the router, easily readable whether wall-mounted or left on your desk, providing visual confirmation of data transfer from the internet, over each wireless band and the guest network, each USB port, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-fast-is-ethernet-817549" >10G connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and each individual Ethernet connection.</p><p> Most of the connectors are located around back, along with a physical switch to turn off the LEDs on the antennas. For connectors, you get an Ethernet jack for connecting to your modem, six individual Ethernet jacks to connect other devices, a 10G LAN SFP+ connector, power input, and a physical power switch.</p><p> Two USB 3.0 type A connectors can be found on the left side of the router as you look at it from the front.

Unlike most routers, the Nighthawk X10 comes completely assembled. Each antenna comes sheathed in a bit of protective plastic, but even that slips right off. The router is basically ready to go right out of the box, which is a big time saver.</p><p> A lot of routers I test require a modem reboot, which is a bit of a pain as my network is set up with the modem and router in different rooms. The Nighthawk X10 AD7200 required no such reboot. I was able to launch Netgear’s routerlogin.net site as soon as I plugged in the Ethernet cable, and the setup process was almost entirely automated after that.</p><p> The Nighthawk X10 did require a firmware update as soon as I got it set up, but that only took a couple of minutes. You’ll also have to budget some extra time if you want to dig into additional features, like the built-in Plex Media Server, but the basic setup process is over really fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RfTANl22rAcY7Xy986eYa_62r44=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_WirelessRouters_NighthawkX10AD7200_02-1721b933d315435f98631847bf3ebb0b.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 (R9000)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Connectivity-AD7200-tri-band-with-MU-MIMO-and-10G-SFP"><a href="#Connectivity-AD7200-tri-band-with-MU-MIMO-and-10G-SFP" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: AD7200 tri-band with MU-MIMO and 10G SFP+"></a><strong>Connectivity: AD7200 tri-band with MU-MIMO and 10G SFP+</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is an AD7200 tri-band router, which means it’s capable of providing 1733Mbps over a 5GHz wireless network, 800Mbps over a 2.4GHz network, and a blistering 4600Mbps over a 60Hz network. That last one is the key feature here, as only 802.11ad routers like this one feature a super-high-speed 60GHz network.</p><p> If you aren’t familiar with 802.11ad, it’s a completely different standard from the more common 802.11ax. While 802.11ax is the successor to 802.11ac, the 802.11ad standard found in this router is a specialized offshoot that offers extremely high speeds and very short distances.</p><p> Also referred to as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-60-ghz-wireless-network-protocols-817936" >WiGig <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> due to its high speeds, 802.11ad supports speeds of up to 7Gbps and transmission distances of up to 30 feet when beamforming is employed, but real-world performance typically maxes out around 15 to 20 feet, and can’t pass through walls or other obstructions.</p><p> In addition to the 60GHz WiGig band, this router also creates simultaneous 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks for your devices that don’t support WiGig, which is likely to be either most or all of them.</p><p> In addition to the 60GHz WiGig band, this router also creates simultaneous 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks for your devices that don’t support WiGig, which is likely to be either most or all of them.</p><p> For physical connectivity, the Nighthawk X10 features six Ethernet ports, two of which can be used together to create a single 2Gbps connection. You also get two USB 3.0 ports for connecting USB drives and a single 10Gbps SFP+ LAN port. This final port is potentially the most interesting, and also most niche since it allows you to connect a high-speed NAS server, a secondary switch for more Ethernet ports, or other devices that require a bunch of high-speed bandwidth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fantastic-5GHz-performance-WiGig-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fantastic-5GHz-performance-WiGig-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fantastic 5GHz performance, WiGig leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fantastic 5GHz performance, WiGig leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> Since this is an 802.11ad router, and the 60GHz WiGig network is the key feature here, that’s where I’m going to start. All of my tests are performed using a 1Gbps Mediacom cable internet connection, so any testing done on an 802.11ad router like this involves data transfer speeds within my network, not the internet connection. For testing purposes, I have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that I retrofitted with a network interface card featuring the QCA9005 chipset.</p><p> Using my test laptop, I was able to connect to the Nighthawk X10’s 60GHz network and measure speeds that topped out at 4.6Gbps. The issue is that in order to maintain a solid connection and record connection speeds anywhere close to 4.6Gbps, I had to place the router on the desk right next to the laptop.</p><p> With the router in its normal position, just a few feet away from my desk, I was only able to manage a transfer speed of a little bit over 1Gbps. Moving my test laptop a bit further away resulted in a dip to barely 300Mbps, and the connection struggled to work at all at a distance of 10 feet with no obstructions.</p><p> The bottom line is that this router provides truly awesome speeds at very short distances, but the benefit falls off sharply, and you’d be better off using the 5GHz network even a few feet away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Jwl6BD38cWznmN0op6bpzAmBs_U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_WirelessRouters_NighthawkX10AD7200_03-4cfe683a7cf94e94b14c0ec2be12da50.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 (R9000)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> To the Nighthawk X10’s credit, the 5GHz network performance exceeded my wildest expectations. Using my 1Gbps Mediacom cable internet connection, I measured a relatively mediocre 373Mbps down and 73.6Mbps up. At the same time, using a wired connection to the same router, I measured 536.8Mbps down.</p><p> Moving about 10 feet away from the router, with a closed-door in the way, the download speed increased to 405Mbps, with 62Mbps up. At about 50 feet out, with several walls, appliances, and pieces of furniture in the way, the connection held strong at 310Mbps down and 49.6Mbps up. That’s one of the best results I’ve seen out of all the 5GHz routers I’ve tested.</p><p> For my final test, I took my phone down to my garage at a distance of about 100 feet, with an unreasonable amount of obstructions between the router and the device. At this distance, most routers fail to connect at all, struggle to maintain a connection, or kick me to the 2.4GHz band.</p><p> The Nighthawk X10 held strong though, dropping the download speed to 38.8Mbps and the upload speed to 13.1Mbps, but without touching the ping, barely increasing jitter, and introducing just 1.2 percent packet loss. Strangely enough, this 802.11ad router’s strongest selling point might be the impressively robust nature of its 5GHz network.</p><p> Strangely enough, this 802.11ad router’s strongest selling point might be the impressively robust nature of its 5 GHz network.</p><h2 id="Software-Netgear’s-web-interface-and-web-app-plus-Plex-and-more"><a href="#Software-Netgear’s-web-interface-and-web-app-plus-Plex-and-more" class="headerlink" title="Software: Netgear’s web interface and web app, plus Plex and more"></a><strong>Software: Netgear’s web interface and web app, plus Plex and more</strong></h2><p> Like its other offerings, Netgear gives you the option to manage the Nighthawk X10 using a web interface or a smartphone app. I used the web interface, and I found it fairly easy to understand and navigate if a bit slow.</p><p> The web portal provides you with basic and advanced tabs, with the basic tab giving you a big picture overview of the router’s status. It shows whether or not the internet is connected, the status of your wireless networks, how many devices are attached, and then gives you a bit of information on the status of the parental controls, the ReadySHARE feature for connecting USB drives, and your guest network.</p><p> Digging into advanced settings is more complicated, and you may find yourself reaching for documentation to find some options that are buried beneath several levels of menus.</p><p> Beyond the basics, this router comes with Plex Media Server built right in, and you can access and configure it through the main Netgear web portal. The way it works is that you can plug storage media into the Nighthawk X10 via the USB ports or the 10G SFP+ port and then stream media directly to Plex clients.</p><p> Aside from the robust 5GHz network, the built-in Plex server is definitely the strongest feature included with this router. I plugged in one of my media-filled SSD USB drives and had no trouble streaming to any of the Plex clients I have on my network.</p><p> I plugged in one of my media-filled SSD USB drives and had no trouble streaming to any of the Plex clients I have on my network.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-if-you-really-need-802-11ad"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-if-you-really-need-802-11ad" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad if you really need 802.11ad"></a><strong>Price: Not bad if you really need 802.11ad</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $500, and a street price closer to $250, the Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is a tough sell to most consumers. It features a wireless technology that hasn’t really caught on, and which most consumers just won’t be able to take advantage of. For the money you’d spend on this router, you could get a high-end 802.11ax router.</p><p> If you do have use for an 802.11ad router, then $250 isn’t that bad of a price tag, especially considering the fantastic 5GHz performance and the convenient inclusion of Plex Media Server. I wouldn’t recommend upgrading your existing equipment to 802.11ad just to use this router, but the Nighthawk X10 makes a fine choice if you already have the hardware to support it.</p><p> By way of comparison, the Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR700 has similar specifications, swaps out Plex Media Server for some gaming-centric quality of life (QoL) features, and has a street price that’s close to $400.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X10-AD7200-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX80"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X10-AD7200-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX80" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 vs. Netgear Nighthawk RAX80"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 vs. Netgear Nighthawk RAX80</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $400, and a street price closer to $350, the Nighthawk RAX80 (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MQDZXA4?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846418%7Cnd55a891e250641509ef77229001ead8021%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is in the same general territory as the Nighthawk X10. The big difference between these competing Nighthawk devices is that one is an 802.11ad router, and the other is an 802.11ax router.</p><p> In terms of real-world 5GHz performance, the Nighthawk X10 actually blows the Nighthawk RAX80 out of the water. It’s important to note that testing was done with 802.11ac devices that couldn’t take full advantage of the Nighthawk RAX80’s full capabilities, but I measured significantly slower speeds from the Nighthawk RAX80 in my 50-foot test, and it wasn’t even able to maintain a 5GHz connection at all in my garage.</p><p> The bottom line here is that the Nighthawk X10 is remarkably good with 5GHz 802.11ac devices, and it’s a good choice if you have 802.11ad devices, but the Nighthawk RAX80 is a better value looking into the future since it supports 802.11ax.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Strong 5GHz performance and Plex Media Center make this a good option if you need an 802.11ad router.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is a bit of a mixed bag since its key feature is so niche. If you really need an 802.11ad router, you may want to look for one with a stronger range. However, this router has fantastic performance on the 5GHz band, and the Plex Media Server implementation is also a very strong plus. If short-range 802.11ad support with excellent fallback 5GHz performance sounds good to you, then this is the router you’re looking for.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X10 AD7200 Router</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  R9000</li><li>Price  $499.99</li><li>Weight  4.11 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.8 x 6.6 x 2.9 in.</li><li>Speed  60GHz: 4,600Mbps; 5GHz: 1,733Mbps; 2.4GHs: 800Mbps</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Compatibility  Windows 7, 8, 10, Vista, XP, or 2000, macOS, UNIX, Linux Product Dimensions</li><li>Firewall  Double firewall, DoS attack prevention</li><li>IPv6 Compatible  Yes</li><li>MU-MIMO  Yes</li><li>Number of Antennas  4</li><li>Number of Bands  Three (92.4 GHz, 5GHz, 60 GHz)</li><li>Number of Wired Ports  6x Gigabit LAN ports, 10G SPF+ LAN port, 2x USB ports, 2x USB 3.0 ports</li><li>Chipset  Alpine AL-514, QCA8337N</li><li>Range  Very large homes</li><li>Parental Controls  Enhanced parental controls</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-deception-navigating-false-subscriber-sells/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Deception  Navigating False Subscriber Sells</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-comprehensible-guide-to-screen-recording-on-the-mi-11/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Comprehensible Guide to Screen Recording on the Mi 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-10-most-shared-stock-photos-and-their-tales/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 10 Most Shared Stock Photos and Their Tales</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-screen-recorder-rivalry-unveiling-the-strengths-of-bandicam-and-camtasia-for-2024/"><u>[New] Screen Recorder Rivalry  Unveiling the Strengths of Bandicam & Camtasia for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-twisting-typography-in-visual-screens-for-2024/"><u>[New] Twisting Typography in Visual Screens for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-survivals-tightrope-ranking-the-top-8-zombie-adventures/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Survival's Tightrope  Ranking the Top 8 Zombie Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/2024s-premier-radio-systems-for-officers/"><u>2024'S Premier Radio Systems for Officers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/battle-royale-showdown-diving-into-fortnites-latest-fun-filled-season/"><u>Battle Royale Showdown: Diving Into Fortnite's Latest Fun-Filled Season</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/convert-with-precision-10-leading-tools-from-flv-to-youtube-platforms-for-2024/"><u>Convert with Precision  10 Leading Tools From Flv to YouTube Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/dissecting-performance-limitations-of-genius-widecam-f100-pixel-issues-and-sound-bounce-explained/"><u>Dissecting Performance Limitations of Genius WideCam F100 -

Even Surface fans will be hard-pressed to spot any difference between the new model and its predecessor. The Laptop 4’s size, weight, and screen size are nearly identical to prior models.</p><p> Inside, it’s a different story. The Surface Laptop 4 has new AMD and Intel processor options that promise not just a boost in performance, but also battery life. This should help the Laptop 4 compete with Dell’s XPS 13 and Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 line—but can it catch up to Apple’s MacBook Air?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mindmanager.sjv.io/c/5597632/1787667/20231" target="_top" id="1787667"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1787667"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1787667/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-If-it’s-not-broken-don’t-fix-it"><a href="#Design-If-it’s-not-broken-don’t-fix-it" class="headerlink" title="Design: If it’s not broken, don’t fix it"></a>Design: If it’s not broken, don’t fix it</h2><p> The Surface Laptop 4 is nearly identical not only to the prior<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but to the original Surface Laptop released in spring of 2017.

It’s easy to forget the Surface Laptop 4, though not a budget laptop, undercuts the more luxurious pricing of ThinkPad and Dell XPS models.</p><p> A tall 3:2 display aspect ratio defines the laptop’s boxy shape. This was the Surface Laptop’s most distinctive feature on its debut and had the benefit of providing more usable screen space.</p><p> I love the fabric interior, which remains a unique design decision but is now optional. The fabric looks and feels more inviting than the metal used by competitors. If you’re worried about how it will hold up: don’t be. Speaking from experience, I can assure you the fabric holds up well. Yes, it will eventually show signs of wear, but it’s no worse than a typical plastic or metal laptop interior.</p><p> Size is the Surface Laptop 4’s only downside. It has a 13.5-inch screen with large bezels, and it’s significantly larger than a typical 13.3-inch laptop with a 16:9 display aspect ratio. The Laptop 4 takes up more space than you’d expect in a bag or on your desk, and its overall footprint is closer to a 14-inch laptop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Pixel-dense-but-mediocre"><a href="#Display-Pixel-dense-but-mediocre" class="headerlink" title="Display: Pixel dense but mediocre"></a>Display: Pixel dense but mediocre</h2><p> The 13.5-inch Surface Laptop 4 has a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-aspect-ratio-1846860" >3:2 display aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a resolution of 2,496 by 1,664.

The Surface Laptop 4 is fast for a Windows device but just can’t compare to Apple’s MacBook line.</p><p> The same is true for battery life.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-air-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092793" >Lifewire’s Jeremy Laukkonen saw about 12 hours of life <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while testing the MacBook Air. I saw a maximum of nine hours from the Surface Laptop 4.</p><p> I like the Surface Laptop 4: it’s a wonderful Windows laptop. Still, the Apple MacBook Air is the better choice for most people. It’s faster yet also more portable, and that’s a hard combination to beat.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macbook-air-13-inch-m1-2020-review-5092793" >Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M1, 2020) Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>One of the best Windows laptops you can get.</strong></p><p> Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 4 is one of the best Windows laptops available today. Its design is attractive, yet functional, and it delivers great performance for the price. The Surface Laptop 4 can’t overcome Apple’s competing MacBooks, but it’s a great pick if you want to stick with Windows.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-5088869" >Microsoft Surface Laptop Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-4797020" >Microsoft Surface Pro 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Surface Laptop 4</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  5PB-00001</li><li>Price  $999.99</li><li>Release Date  April 2021</li><li>Weight  2.79 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.1 x 8.8 x 0.57 in.</li><li>Color  Ice Blue, Matte Black, Platinum, Sandstone</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  AMD Ryzen 5 4680U Microsoft Surface Edition</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  256GB</li><li>Camera  720p with IR camera</li><li>Battery Capacity  47 watt-hours</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 1x USB-A, 3.5mm combo headphone&#x2F;microphone, Surface power adapter</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audience-wow-factor-best-stream-cameras-for-your-twitch-channel/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Audience Wow Factor  Best Stream Cameras for Your Twitch Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-zero-to-hero-on-twitter-live/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Zero to Hero on Twitter Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-no-price-tag-on-adventure-top-10-gratuitous-online-rpgs/"><u>[New] In 2024, No Price Tag On Adventure  Top 10 Gratuitous Online RPGs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-climbing-the-popularity-ladder-with-staff-chosen-videos-at-vimeo/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Climbing the Popularity Ladder with Staff-Chosen Videos at Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-secrets-of-saving-gameplay-on-windows-10/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Secrets of Saving Gameplay on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-protect-and-enhance-images-with-top-tools/"><u>[Updated] Protect & Enhance Images with Top Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/essential-guide-to-using-windows-11s-compatibility-fixer/"><u>Essential Guide to Using Windows 11’S Compatibility Fixer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/evaluating-wireless-mesh-network-benefits/"><u>Evaluating Wireless Mesh Network Benefits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/examining-the-lenovo-130s-a-user-friendly-laptop-despite-its-constrained-power-capacity/"><u>Examining the Lenovo 130S: A User-Friendly Laptop Despite Its Constrained Power Capacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/experience-fun-on-the-waves-with-the-propella-7s-40-a-light-agile-and-budget-friendly-choice/"><u>Experience Fun on the Waves with the Propella 7S 4.0: A Light, Agile and Budget-Friendly Choice!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-oceans-with-insta360-x2-ultimate-underwater-vision/"><u>Exploring Oceans with Insta360 X2: Ultimate Underwater Vision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-best-multiplatform-editor-why-gimp-stands-out-as-a-leading-free-option/"><u>Exploring the Best Multiplatform Editor: Why GIMP Stands Out as a Leading Free Option</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exploring-the-enhanced-features-of-the-apple-watch-series-6-the-top-pick-remains-unchallenged/"><u>Exploring the Enhanced Features of the Apple Watch Series 6 -
