However, we’ve kept the review live for informational purposes.</p><p> <em>We purchased the Anker PowerCore+ 26800 Battery Pack Bundle so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Anker has made a name for itself as one of the most reliable gadgets and accessories manufacturers in the game. Despite their reasonable prices, the quality continues to impress and its Anker PowerCore+ 26800 PD with 30W Power Delivery Charger is no exception. We’ve spent some time with this laptop battery charger and put it to the test to see just how well Anker’s compact battery pack holds up against a variety of gadgets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Plush-and-light-for-travelers"><a href="#Design-Plush-and-light-for-travelers" class="headerlink" title="Design: Plush and light for travelers"></a><strong>Design: Plush and light for travelers</strong></h2><p> If you’ve owned any Anker products, you’ll immediately recognize the PowerCore+ 26800. It features a minimal rectangular design made of extruded aluminum with rounded edges for a very smooth look and feel. It weighs roughly 1.3 pounds, which gives it a premium feel without feeling too heavy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/brfc42RYlVrJLOHjyc0IbNzEQ0k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-3-_5Web-5c90fc18c9e77c0001ac191d.jpg"                      alt="Anker"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1936838">                    <video width="374" height="48" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1936838">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:234px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcoinrule.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1936838%2F18409'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1936838/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> The PowerCore+ 26800 features a single button on the top of the device to show remaining battery life and three ports on one of the two flat sides: two 5V&#x2F;3A PowerIQ USB ports (Power IQ is Anker’s proprietary smart-charging standard) and a power delivery<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port.

Inside the box is the battery pack, a 30W USB Type-C wall charger, and two cables: a USB Type-C to USB Type-C and a micro USB to USB Type-C.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ps-fDFicjMGSS8OppN-xw5yn_mg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-3-_1-Web-5c90fc3dc9e77c0001eb1cc5.jpg"                      alt="Anker"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137209/26400" target="_top" id="2137209">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137209" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137209/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> Our device came approximately 50% charged based on the battery life indicator lights on the top. We immediately burned through what battery life it had so we could start fresh with testing to see how quickly the 30W wall charger could fill the 26800mAh capacity.</p><p> It’s a no-frills design that looks great when paired with any clean, modern device if you care about form as much as function.</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race</strong></h2><p> From zero percent battery life, the PowerCore+ 26800 charged to 100% in four hours flat, both in our initial test and our eight additional battery cycles, with only ten or fifteen-minute variances. This time lines up perfectly with Anker’s given timeframe, which states it will charge in four hours when using the included 30W<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> wall charger and USB Type-C cable.</p><p> The Anker PowerCore+ 26800 retails for $129.99. That alone is a deal in terms of power output, but add in the accessories and it’s an absolute steal.</p><p> We tested the PowerCore+ 26800’s charging abilities using three different devices: two smartphones and a laptop. The smartphones we used were an iPhone XS and a Samsung Galaxy S8 Active and the laptop we had on hand was a 2016 MacBook Pro 15-inch.</p><p> For the smartphones, we made sure the PowerCore+ 26800 was charged up entirely and ran both the iPhone XS and Samsung Galaxy S8 Active through complete battery cycles until the battery pack was out of juice. The iPhone XS was charged six and a half times with an average time of an hour and a half using the PowerIQ USB port with a Lightning cable. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Active, on the other hand, managed seven and a half charges with an average charge time of an hour and fifteen minutes using the included USB Type-C to USB Type-C cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/tJwshohQXfV-U0_iKVTCkHEhFLU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-3-_6Web-5c90fcc6c9e77c0001a92733.jpg"                      alt="Anker"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> We tested the PowerCore+ 26800 on our 2016 MacBook Pro 15-inch four different times to get a solid average. With the laptop completely dead, the battery pack managed to charge it to 100% in just three and a half hours with a little battery life to spare.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148648/16836" target="_top" id="2148648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148648/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Perfectly-priced-for-its-power"><a href="#Price-Perfectly-priced-for-its-power" class="headerlink" title="Price: Perfectly priced for its power"></a><strong>Price: Perfectly priced for its power</strong></h2><p> The Anker PowerCore+ 26800 retails for $129.99. That alone is a deal in terms of power output, but add in the 30W USB wall charger and the two cables and it’s an absolute steal. The USB wall charger alone goes for $25.99 and the cables easily add up to $10 together, meaning you’re effectively paying $100 for the charger.</p><h2 id="Anker-PowerCore-26800-vs-RAVPower-26800"><a href="#Anker-PowerCore-26800-vs-RAVPower-26800" class="headerlink" title="Anker PowerCore+ 26800 vs. RAVPower 26800"></a><strong>Anker PowerCore+ 26800 vs. RAVPower 26800</strong></h2><p> Anker PowerCore+ 26800 has an almost identical competitor, the RAVPower 26800. The two battery packs feature the exact same capacity and both are capable of outputting 30W charging via their respective USB Type-C ports.</p><p> The RAVPower 26800 retails for $79.99, a full $50 less than the Anker PowerCore+ 26800, but it doesn’t include the USB wall charger. It also recharges using Micro USB, meaning it’s going to be a fair bit slower than the Anker PowerCore+ 26800, which uses USB Type-C. RAVPower claims its battery pack can recharge fully in 4-5 hours.</p><p> Want to take a look at some other options?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 is designed to deliver high-performance features in a low-budget package; this model has a great range and a high-intensity LED display. Let’s take a closer look at some strengths and weaknesses to evaluate what kind of performance you can expect on the road.</p><h2 id="Design-A-bit-cheap"><a href="#Design-A-bit-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Design: A bit cheap"></a><strong>Design:</strong> <strong>A bit cheap</strong></h2><p> The S55 is palm-sized, about comparable in size and shape to most other radar detectors. The plastic material feels a bit cheaper than other radar detectors I’ve tested, though the control buttons worked well and felt long-lasting and I never had issues with them sticking. The Passport S55 comes with a very small windshield mount that’s functional, but you may want to consider an aftermarket mount. It’s minimal with small suction cups and I’m not confident it will last long. Luckily, the lightweight design of the S55 means it doesn’t need much to hold it in place.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display shows bright red text&#x2F;symbols for maximum visibility while driving. The S55 can show four signal strength meters at the same time, plus the numeric frequency of alerts. There’s also a dark mode that turns off the display but doesn’t disable the audio alert.</p><p> The speaker on this radar detector is very small, about a quarter-inch square, but the audio alerts are high volume. You can select between standard and loud tones. The SmartCord power cable for the S55 has a handy mute button on it so you don’t have to reach over the dash.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-installation"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-installation" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy installation"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy installation</strong></h2><p> The S55 is straightforward and easy to install. Simply stick the windshield mount in place and plug the SmartCord lighter adapter into your car’s DC cigarette lighter input. Plugging the modular jack into the S55 will automatically power on the radar detector and you can quickly customize settings for display brightness, detector sensitivity levels, and volume. Then you’re ready to hit the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014859/22899" target="_top" id="2014859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014859/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Range-Impressive-detection"><a href="#Range-Impressive-detection" class="headerlink" title="Range: Impressive detection"></a><strong>Range: Impressive detection</strong></h2><p> The Passport S55 features Enhanced Radar Protection that delivers long-distance range for laser and radar bands, including K and Ka bands, widely used microwave frequencies for police radar guns. It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity. While testing the S55 in Highway mode I received Ka-band alerts over a mile and a half out from where I approached a highway patrol parked on the median of the interstate. This range was on par with much more expensive models.</p><p> It reliably delivers on its promise of long-distance sensitivity.</p><h2 id="Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced"><a href="#Performance-Not-exactly-enhanced" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Not exactly enhanced"></a><strong>Performance: Not exactly enhanced</strong></h2><p> The S55 has different modes designed to adjust to specific frequency bands and sensitivity levels for city or highway driving. You can quickly customize the settings by using the included quick reference guide. You can also turn off specific frequency bands if they tend to give a lot of false alerts.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><p> In terms of false alerts, the AutoSensitivity feature didn’t really help in directing the overall high-sensitivity. This radar detector gave frequent false alerts from commercial door-openers and vehicle anti-collision warning systems. Unfortunately, the S55 lacks the advanced filters of more expensive models that help reduce the annoying frequency of false alerts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134238/18498" target="_top" id="2134238">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134238" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134238/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for"><a href="#Price-You-get-what-you-pay-for" class="headerlink" title="Price: You get what you pay for"></a><strong>Price: You get what you pay for</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $128, the Passport S55 is a low-end radar detector priced accordingly. More advanced radar detectors can easily be several hundred dollars more expensive, and the S55 is a good deal if you plan to use it primarily on the highway. Door-openers along the city and commercial roads will frequently trigger false alerts. You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><p> You get what you pay for with the Escort Passport S55—maximum sensitivity and range without advanced filtering capabilities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134230/18498" target="_top" id="2134230">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134230" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134230/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector"><a href="#Escort-Passport-S55-vs-Uniden-DFR9-Super-long-range-Radar-Laser-Detector" class="headerlink" title="Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector"></a><strong>Escort Passport S55 vs. Uniden DFR9 Super long-range Radar&#x2F;Laser Detector</strong></h2><p> A popular competitor brand to Escort that makes a wide selection of radar detectors is Uniden. The Uniden DFR9 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniden-DFR9-Detection-Cameras-Display/dp/B07F6PZXHM/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4799949%7Cncd245a3f879640b69fbbb5e95c20e78e20%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a model that can be considered the next price tier above the S55. The DFR9’s MSRP is $300 but it can often be found on sale for about $270.</p><p> The DFR9 has an excellent detection range and a color LED display. The DFR9 also features GPS technology that filters out stationary false alerts, a welcome addition in mid-level radar detectors, and supports database access which alerts you to red light and speed camera locations.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A basic radar detector that’s ideal for beginners or anyone on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Escort Passport S55 has reliable long-range detection, but I found its performance and range of features to be pretty basic. This unit never missed the presence of parked police down the highway who appeared to be using radar guns, which means I’m confident in recommending this model for those on a budget. However, buyer beware that false alerts are an unavoidable inconvenience with this model.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Passport S55</li><li>Product Brand  Escort</li><li>SKU  B019HF60EI</li><li>Price  $189.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.6 x 3.75 x 1 in.</li><li>Warranty  Limited One Year Warranty</li><li>Display size  1&#x2F;4”H x 1 3&#x2F;4”L</li><li>Display type  280 LED Matrix&#x2F;Text</li><li>Radar receiver  Superheterodyne, Varactor-Tuned VCO, Scanning Frequency, Discriminator, Digital Signal Processing (DSP)</li><li>Power requirements  12 VDC, Negative Ground (car lighter&#x2F;accessory)</li><li>GPS  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-vanguard-of-virtual-storage-top-choices/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Vanguard of Virtual Storage Top Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-balance-quality-and-quickness-with-netflix-speed-modification-tips/"><u>[Updated] Balance Quality & Quickness with Netflix Speed Modification Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/44cm5zplus656so55plusl6k2y44ks5bplusy44km44ga44gr77ya44ot44oh44kq44ke6zplusz5aow44ov44kh44kk44or55so44gu6yen6kab5oqa6kgt44cb44kz44o844oh44od44kv6kej6kqs44cn113/"><u>「基礎知識を忘れずに：ビデオや音声ファイル用の重要技術、コーデック解説」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-apple-id-verification-code-not-working-from-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Fix Apple ID Verification Code Not Working From Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-motorola-edge-2023-phone-password-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Motorola Edge 2023 Phone Password Without Factory Reset?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-tutorial-for-activating-icloud-from-iphone-14-plus-safe-and-legal-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Easy Tutorial for Activating iCloud from iPhone 14 Plus Safe and Legal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-inside-the-world-of-digital-performer-reviews/"><u>In 2024, Inside the World of Digital Performer Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-top-performing-flash-drives-to-choose-from/"><u>The Top Performing Flash Drives to Choose From</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-fitbit-charge-4-when-elegance-meets-utility/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Fitbit Charge 4: When Elegance Meets Utility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-highly-rated-and-economical-fossil-athletic-wear/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Highly Rated & Economical Fossil Athletic Wear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-selecting-a-premium-travel-wireless-router-2024-edition/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Selecting a Premium Travel Wireless Router - 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-review-of-omnicharges-omni-20-portable-power-bank-your-go-to-companion-for-effortless-charging-via-qi-wireless-technology/"><u>The Ultimate Review of Omnicharge's Omni 20 Portable Power Bank - Your Go-To Companion for Effortless Charging via Qi Wireless Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-showdown-assessing-the-pros-and-cons-of-echo-dot-vs-homepod-mini/"><u>The Ultimate Showdown: Assessing the Pros & Cons of Echo Dot Vs.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you moderate your expectations, the Blueear Bluetooth Beanie Hat is worth considering. It’s not an amazing hat nor a powerhouse audio experience, but it’s a reasonable compromise of fashion and utility. Its discreet appearance makes a good accessory for a winter outfit, and the sound produced by the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/all-about-speakers-4125129" >speakers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is good enough to justify the price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IcCCPdp0TK1sbRWzr9VsPydtSLY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4159779_05-73c2b4a42b6b43f48ac4d02283d02657.jpg"                      alt="Blueear Bluetooth Beanie Hat"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Simple-and-discreet"><a href="#Design-Simple-and-discreet" class="headerlink" title="Design: Simple and discreet"></a><strong>Design: Simple and discreet</strong></h2><p> The idea behind this Bluetooth beanie is very simple and effective. Take a beanie and stitch up some inexpensive Bluetooth speakers in the seam. The speakers are inserted in a little pouch over each ear. Once the cap is on, you can push the speakers around so they fit your head precisely. You’ll have to adjust the speakers every time you put the beanie on, which gets annoying after a while.</p><p> You can get this beanie in six colors and textures. We chose carbon black for our test unit. You can also get it in black, grey, dark grey, H1 grey, and H4 black. When selecting the color you want, keep in mind that the design weave varies from color to color.</p><p> The size of the beanie will also change depending on what color you choose. The carbon black option is 10 inches from bottom to top. Unless you have a head the size and shape of a space alien, most of the top will rest on the back of your head. The rest of the options are only 8.5 inches, something to bear in mind when picking which color you want.</p><p> The quality of the sound generated by this Bluetooth beanie is listenable, but won’t likely forget that you’re listening by way of tiny speakers in a $15 beanie.</p><p> The built-in microphone allows you to use voice commands and take phone calls or other audio communications, but won’t let you access digital assistants like Siri.</p><p> The promotional materials and user manual for this Bluetooth beanie highlight that you can easily remove the speakers when you need to wash it. However, it’s not immediately obvious how to do that, nor are there any instructions in the manual.</p><p> The Bluetooth range is listed as the standard 10m, or about 30 feet. We found that to be generally accurate so long as you have a direct line of sight to the phone or computer it’s paired to. If walls and other objects get in the way, the range drops sharply.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/3aVPDXCbn533gdsOOMrbCMHgUo8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4159779_02-39d07d95367d404e8e36d49ecd0f6aaa.jpg"                      alt="Blueear Bluetooth Beanie Hat"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Just-like-any-other-Bluetooth-device"><a href="#Setup-Process-Just-like-any-other-Bluetooth-device" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Just like any other Bluetooth device"></a><strong>Setup Process: Just like any other Bluetooth device</strong></h2><p> Anyone familiar with pairing Bluetooth devices shouldn’t run into many problems setting up this beanie. All you have to do is hold the play button down for three seconds to make it discoverable on the device you want to pair it with. The hat will show up as “Magic Hat” on your list of available Bluetooth devices.</p><p> Out of the box, it took us less than one minute to start listening to music from our iPhone X on this Bluetooth beanie. All we had to do was pair it via the Bluetooth settings. However, when we paired it with a Mac, we had to pair it in the Bluetooth settings and manually route the computer’s audio to it via the sound settings.</p><p> Switching between paired devices isn’t quite as seamless as we’ve seen in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-earbuds-4140480" >Bluetooth earbuds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-airpods-review-4589511" >AirPods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/beats-powerbeats-pro-review-4694361" >PowerBeats Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . During our testing phase, it generally took about one minute to switch from a Mac to an iPhone. It took even longer from an iPhone to a Mac since you have to route the audio manually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vDgOpMTjzx4rXxlDNddSrWYNiDA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4159779_06-ea3ea611fbf8423e9221af228b7c37e4.jpg"                      alt="Blueear Bluetooth Beanie Hat"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1828647/21290" target="_top" id="1828647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1828647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1828647/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Controls-Awkward-but-easy"><a href="#Controls-Awkward-but-easy" class="headerlink" title="Controls: Awkward but easy"></a><strong>Controls: Awkward but easy</strong></h2><p> The control panel sewed into the band sits over your left ear. This is an odd place for it for right handed people, requiring them to reach across their torso and face to use it with their dominant hand. Nevertheless, the controls are easy and complete. Controls include volume, pause, play, previous and next track. It only takes a few minutes of using the cap to learn its controls effectively.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Life-Good-but-not-as-advertised"><a href="#Battery-Life-Good-but-not-as-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Good, but not as advertised"></a><strong>Battery Life: Good, but not as advertised</strong></h2><p> Blueear claims a full battery will yield eight hours of listening time from this Bluetooth beanie. However, we never got past six hours of continuous use during our testing phase. That’s more than enough juice to get you through an autumn hike or a winter evening night out, but if you’re going to be outside all day and want your tunes the whole time, you’ll probably want to invest in a pair of heavy-duty wireless earbuds like the Powerbeats Pro.</p><p> All of the small foibles of this Bluetooth beanie are forgivable because it’s not an expensive product.</p><p> It takes a little more than an hour to fully charge this Bluetooth beanie. You can charge the speakers through a small hole in the fabric via an included USB charging cable. It doesn’t come with wall adapter, but if you don’t have one kicking around you can also plug it into a computer or other USB equipped device.</p><h2 id="Comfort-Kinda-scratchy-but-you’ll-get-used-to-it"><a href="#Comfort-Kinda-scratchy-but-you’ll-get-used-to-it" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Kinda scratchy, but you’ll get used to it"></a><strong>Comfort: Kinda scratchy, but you’ll get used to it</strong></h2><p> This Bluetooth beanie is made of 100% acrylic fibers. It’s not as comfortable as you might expect by looking at it. When we tested the product, it felt dry and scratchy and caused mild chafing around the ears and neck. Nothing that will leave a mark or cause blisters, but enough that you’ll never forget you’re wearing the hat.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Decent-sound-from-inexpensive-speakers"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Decent-sound-from-inexpensive-speakers" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Decent sound from inexpensive speakers"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Decent sound from inexpensive speakers</strong></h2><p> The quality of the sound generated by this Bluetooth beanie is listenable, but won’t likely forget that you’re listening by way of tiny speakers in a $15 beanie.

But the Rotibox is a good deal more comfortable, and it produces better sound. The best thing Blueear has going for it is that it’s the least expensive wireless music beanie we reviewed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/rotibox-bluetooth-beanie-hat-review-4774412" >Rotibox Bluetooth Beanie Hat Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If you’re looking for a superior, comfortable winter beanie or a powerful audio experience, this is not the product for you.</strong></p><p> However, if you’re interested in an average beanie and decent sound at a bargain basement price, it’s a good pick.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Minecraft is the ultimate indie gaming success story, gradually transforming from a solo project into a worldwide phenomenon with more than 100 million monthly active users, spinoff games, merchandise, conventions, and so much more. But it’s not all the stuff that makes Minecraft one of the world’s most popular games—it’s the game itself.</p><p> Even a decade after its original alpha release, Minecraft remains a pure and compelling sandbox experience, dropping players into a blocky world full of seemingly endless possibilities. It has no storyline, no missions, and no obvious hooks to pull you into the game. It’s essentially a blank canvas—a blocky, pixelated blank canvas. But the beauty of Minecraft is that not only is there so much more going on beneath the surface (literally, too), but the freeform design enables new and diverse kinds of play and is especially great for younger players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KGxRcqpBaclCQ1bsvEvVp8tW4mQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-5-fe58f36987fa4b869ec30d969ff99e0a.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186802/12108" target="_top" id="1186802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186802/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-DIY"><a href="#Plot-DIY" class="headerlink" title="Plot: DIY"></a><strong>Plot: DIY</strong></h2><p> Believe it or not, there is no plot in Minecraft—and no storyline or fleshed-out characters, either, although the boy and girl character skins are referred to as Steve and Alex, respectively. Minecraft is a freeform playground in which to use your own imagination to create adventures and narratives. Minecraft won’t do that heavy lifting for you, although there is an increasing number of storylines found externally in official books, comics, and spin-off games.</p><p> Minecraft is a freeform playground in which to use your own imagination to create adventures and narratives.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Lb_hrm4JI7-x9US5xPk5IZTKIo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-3-8c54d379492a429c9c74e7fd51831a90.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-on-the-surface"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-on-the-surface" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple on the surface"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple on the surface</strong></h2><p> The name of the game in Minecraft is simplicity. While there are hundreds of items to discover, craft, and use, as well as various creatures to interact with, Minecraft never complicates the way that you actually interact with each randomly-generated game world.</p><p> As a blocky hero, you’ll explore the likewise blocky world by using the analog stick on your control, keys on your keyboard, or digital directional pad on your screen—depending on which device you’re playing on. You can jump, destroy blocks and items (mine), place blocks and items, and use menus to manage your inventory and use the crafting interface. It’s not a whole lot, and while there are some other minor game mechanics that pop up along the way, it’s amazing to see a five- or six-year-old grab the controller and quickly get comfortable.</p><p> My six-year-old son has become obsessed not only with playing Minecraft and experimenting within, but also reading about the ecosystem in books and gaining ideas for his next session.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-minecraft-2363311" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> splits its experience into two core modes: Survival and Creative. Survival is the closest thing there is to an “adventure,” although it’s still pretty unstructured. You start with essentially nothing in Survival, which means it’s up to you to make the most of your surroundings. You’ll need to mine materials from trees and earth, build a shelter to protect yourself from the enemies that come out at night, and eventually assemble a crafting table to unlock many more possibilities. You have a wellness bar and are bound by gravity, so it’s about as close to a simulation as Minecraft gets.</p><p> Creative mode, on the other hand, removes the shackles. You have access to every single item available in the game, plus you can float through the air at will. With no life bar and no fear of peril, this is the mode for experimenting with the game’s many, many resources, as well as the mode for crafting massive, elaborate structures. Both modes offer a very different slice of Minecraft, and you might find yourself gravitating towards one or the other.</p><p> Some players will undoubtedly find Minecraft to be aimless, or even pointless. Without the kind of structure and deliberate nudges built into most other games, anyone expecting the Minecraft to do the work for them might be sorely disappointed. But for those who embrace the freeform nature of the experience, this pure sandbox affair can be deeply captivating. And the myriad nuances of the world and its creatures and items are likewise compelling. My six-year-old son has become obsessed not only with playing Minecraft and experimenting within, but also reading about the ecosystem in books and gaining ideas for his next session. It almost becomes a mindset more than just a game, but at least it’s one you can feel comfortable with.</p><p> Minecraft also has a significant multiplayer and modding component. Players can connect online to play together in both the Creative and Survival modes, or even connect to dedicated servers via the premium Minecraft Realms service. Realms charges a monthly fee, but lets you share an ongoing game world with friends far and wide. Both ways are also a great opportunity for parents and children to play together, plus the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions of Minecraft offer split-screen local multiplayer.</p><p> Minecraft remains such a pure and compelling sandbox experience, dropping players into a blocky world full of seemingly endless possibilities.</p><p> The PC, Xbox One, Switch, and mobile versions of Minecraft all feature a built-in Marketplace, where you can download character skins and community-made game modes. There are officially-licensed content packs based on the likes of Toy Story and Adventure Time, as well as mini-games and unique play modes to download and enjoy. Some of these features are free, while others require you to purchase in-game Minecraft Coins to access them. Sadly, the Marketplace isn’t available on PlayStation 4 due to Sony’s restrictions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KZOlKmF7mtow8s24LyCEegfMQeA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-4-4fa0600f16e3489686b18da7be164b82.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Graphics-All-block-everything"><a href="#Graphics-All-block-everything" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: All block everything"></a><strong>Graphics: All block everything</strong></h2><p> It’s all chunky and fuzzy in Minecraft, which uses a voxel-based system that makes everything look like giant 3D pixels. Even human characters and animals are boxy-looking, but that’s part of the lo-fi charm of the game. The Minecraft look has become iconic over the last 10 years, and influenced an untold number of other games since. There are visual modifications available that smooth out the graphics or apply lifelike textures, but the core look is decidedly Minecraft.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vtgr1TMhJGVqcjBzkQXrnRqhUsY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-6-0ca6fe5018cf465caed86f1b81ef3e36.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Kid-Appropriate-They-play-it-in-schools-seriously"><a href="#Kid-Appropriate-They-play-it-in-schools-seriously" class="headerlink" title="Kid Appropriate: They play it in schools (seriously)"></a><strong>Kid Appropriate: They play it in schools (seriously)</strong></h2><p> Minecraft is rated Everyone 10+ by the ESRB. You can craft and wield weapons such as swords, axes, and a bow and arrow, and use them to slay beasts such as zombies and the explosive Creeper, as well as attack and kill animals like pigs and wolves. You can also set animals and creatures on fire. However, it’s all presented in the same kind of goofy, pixel-stylized design and isn’t graphic or realistic at all. Escaping enemies in the nighttime can be intense, however, so younger players might do better with Creative mode or by staying inside of a shelter all night in Survival mode.</p><p> Teachers have customized and designed Minecraft worlds and scenarios that help deliver interactive lessons in history, science, math, and more.</p><p> How kid-appropriate is Minecraft? Appropriate enough for Microsoft to have designed an Education Edition of the game that is used for a wide array of subjects in classrooms around the world. Teachers have customized and designed Minecraft worlds and scenarios that help deliver interactive lessons in history, science, math, and more. Yes, it’s entirely possible that your kid’s experience playing Minecraft will come in handy at school—and also likely that Minecraft can help get your kid excited about a typically-rote subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0-VNwmWbUKQwP5ADxnWHIOr9zwQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-2-e2c20e8d4ac643a8afd8d37093a369cd.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/c/5597632/1622438/14044" target="_top" id="1622438">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14044-1622438" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/i/5597632/1622438/14044"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Price-A-fantastic-deal"><a href="#Price-A-fantastic-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A fantastic deal"></a><strong>Price: A fantastic deal</strong></h2><p> Minecraft is an excellent value at $20 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions of the game, and just $7 for the iOS and Android editions. That’s a steal for a game that players could potentially pour hundreds or thousands of hours into. The in-game Marketplace purchases might seem a bit pricey by comparison, with some content packs and new modes selling for the equivalent of $5+ apiece, but it could be a small price to pay to help keep an already-cheap game fresh for longer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135360/19272" target="_top" id="2135360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135360/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Minecraft-vs-LEGO-Worlds"><a href="#Minecraft-vs-LEGO-Worlds" class="headerlink" title="Minecraft vs. LEGO Worlds"></a><strong>Minecraft vs. LEGO Worlds</strong></h2><p> Minecraft has been described as many as modern-day or digital LEGOs although there actually are licensed LEGO Minecraft building kits out there. However, in the gaming world, LEGO tried to capitalize on the Minecraft phenomenon by making its own creative building game called<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Worlds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Released in 2017, LEGO Worlds does things a bit differently, with a hilarious narrator giving cues and little LEGO minifigure characters doling out missions. We really liked the game’s unique, LEGO-built worlds and wide array of building possibilities, however, the building controls aren’t nearly as intuitive as in Minecraft, plus it turns repetitive faster. LEGO Worlds also hasn’t caught on to nearly the same extent as Minecraft, which remains a bona fide sensation today. Chances are much better that your friends are playing Minecraft than LEGO Worlds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Dimensions Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A modern classic.</strong></p><p> Even a decade after release, Minecraft is an essential gaming experience for players of all ages, and especially for younger gamers. The sandbox design means that players can drop in and concoct their own experiences in each randomly-generated world, and the way it hooks in kids via good, old-fashioned creativity and experimentation is a sight to behold. Minecraft’s open-ended design won’t be for everyone—but it’s something truly special for those who embrace it.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Minecraft</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>Price  $19.99</li><li>Release Date  October 2011</li><li>Platforms  Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, Windows PC, iOS, Android</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-maximize-your-google-meet-experience-without-paying-a-penny/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Maximize Your Google Meet Experience, Without Paying a Penny</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-safaris-picture-in-picture-on-ios-and-ipad-how-to-use/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Safari's Picture-in-Picture on iOS & iPad How to Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-performance-of-yis-4k-actioncam-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Performance of Yi's 4K ActionCam for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/apple-watch-series-4-reviewed-surpassing-expectations-with-superior-features/"><u>Apple Watch Series 4 Reviewed: Surpassing Expectations with Superior Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/asus-vivobook-11-user-guide-compact-design-and-budget-friendly-performance/"><u>ASUS VivoBook 11 User Guide: Compact Design and Budget-Friendly Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/avoiding-connectivity-hiccups-top-wireless-travel-routers-of-2024-reviewed/"><u>Avoiding Connectivity Hiccups: Top Wireless Travel Routers of 2024 Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/breakthrough-analysis-the-ingenious-design-of-b550-xt/"><u>Breakthrough Analysis: The Ingenious Design of B550-XT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/byb-e4-30-led-lamp-inspection-exclusive-look-at-the-premium-armless-light-design/"><u>BYB E4 30-LED Lamp Inspection: Exclusive Look at the Premium Armless Light Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/capturing-excellence-at-a-low-cost-but-with-hassles-nikon-a10/"><u>Capturing Excellence at a Low Cost - But With Hassles?

and value, it’s not a big surprise that the ergonomic keyboard wrist rest from Gimars is a popular choice. It’s long enough to pair nicely with any full-sized keyboard or laptop and tall enough to keep your hands at a natural, comfortable elevation level.</p><p> The memory foam material provides plenty of cushion and support for your wrists, slowly bouncing back to its original shape when you lift your hands away. On the bottom, a textured anti-slip gel material keeps the wrist rest from sliding around on your desk, with small circular stickers included to help keep it even more secure.</p><p> Adding to the product’s value is the matching mouse wrist rest. Made of the same soft, breathable material, it’s another valuable accessory for using a mouse with your computer.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Memory foam |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 17x3.4x1 inches</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130531/26400" target="_top" id="2130531">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130531" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130531/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Budget-Buy"><a href="#Budget-Buy" class="headerlink" title="Budget Buy"></a>Budget Buy</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR" >Yolanda Keyboard Wrist Rest Set <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6gEW_F55hlzg63RbBKHHiqPPnYU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/upgrade-3pcs-gel-memory-foam-keyboard-wrist-rest-support-set-ergonomic-design-easy-typing-pain-relief-for-computer-mac-laptop-home--office-ddea09d1517e412782863d8954c9551a.jpg" >Upgrade 3Pcs Gel Memory Foam Keyboard Wrist Rest Support Set, Ergonomic Design Easy Typing Pain Relief for Computer, Mac Laptop, Home &amp; Office <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ6JWGR?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB07RQ6JWGR" >$10 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Low price</li><li>Mouse pad and mouse wrist rest included</li><li>Comfortable memory foam material</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Potential durability issues over time</li></ul><p> If you’re looking to upgrade your home or office setup on a limited budget, the Yolanda wrist rest set gives you a lot of accessories for your money.

It’s made of lightweight memory foam that feels soft on the wrists and helps them maintain proper positioning when you type. All three parts of the set lie flat without curling up, with non-slip rubber on the base to keep them from shifting around while you use them.</p><p> While durability issues may be an issue after a certain amount of time, most people will get plenty of use for minimal cost.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Memory foam |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 17x3.3x1 inches</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI" >Kensington Duo Gel Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AjV8BEfsP7QY2B8f8vxSz9q5Zek=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/kensington-duo-gel-keyboard-wrist-rest---blue-k62397am-347fceaaefbf4f7f9951de4a3085fb97.jpg" >Kensington Duo Gel Keyboard Wrist Rest - Blue (K62397AM) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178FBICI/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB0178FBICI" >$18 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/48946320" >$21 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/accessories-and-software/keyboards-and-mice/mouse-pads/78016541?slfpid=3" >$35 at Lenovo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Bold two-color design</li><li>Supportive gel pillows</li><li>Built-in ventilation</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Susceptible to damage</li></ul><p> Most keyboard wrist rests stick with simple, understated designs, but the Kensington Duo Gel Keyboard Wrist Rest quickly catches the eye. It’s constructed with two sleekly curved sections—one black, the other in your choice of blue, red, or gray. The shine of the gel material on the inside helps it stand out even more.</p><p> On the practical side, the split design creates a ventilation channel along the middle of the product, which helps to keep your hands dry and cool as you type away. Most importantly, for a wrist rest, the gel pillow material supports your wrists, holding its shape better than memory foam alternatives that may flatten over time. Thanks to a plastic surface, you can more readily wipe off than fabric coverings; it’s also easier to clean.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Gel |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 19x3.7x1 inches</p><h2 id="Best-for-Laptops"><a href="#Best-for-Laptops" class="headerlink" title="Best for Laptops"></a>Best for Laptops</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG" >AQUUES WavePads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Iwqn4bSRwu8m8NBjBhbfndJXYU8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/wavepads-by-aquues-solutions--two-pack-non-slip-wrist-rests-for-laptop-and-keyboard-ergonomic-memory-foam-laptop-wrist-pads-for-wrist-pain--carpal-cb129c52fb544c708b57063d637b5a53.jpg" >WavePads by AQUUES Solutions &acirc; Two Pack Non-Slip Wrist Rests for Laptop and Keyboard Ergonomic Memory Foam Laptop Wrist Pads for Wrist Pain &amp; Carpal… <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QZ6KCRG?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08QZ6KCRG" >$25 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://postureupshop.com/products/wavepads" >View on Postureupshop.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Cleverly designed for laptop use</li><li>Easy to reposition and travel with</li><li>Usable with any keyboard or mouse</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>May not stay in place enough</li><li>Pricey</li></ul><p> Just about any keyboard wrist rest can work with a laptop by positioning it in front of the machine.

They consist of two squares of high-density memory foam on either side of the trackpad, providing support and comfort right where your wrists naturally fall when you type on your laptop keyboard.</p><p> Non-stick surfaces on the base of the WavePads help keep them in place (though you might experience some slipping). These won’t leave residue on your laptop without any adhesive materials.</p><p> You can reposition them or even pick them up to take on the go, and you can use the provided elegant metal clip to carry them neatly while traveling. The portable, versatile nature of the WavePads also makes them great wrist rests for an external keyboard or mouse, not just laptops.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Memory foam |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 3.5x3.5x0.625 inches (x2)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-extended-mouse-pads-4584491" >The Best Extended Mouse Pads of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-for-the-Office"><a href="#Best-for-the-Office" class="headerlink" title="Best for the Office"></a>Best for the Office</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2" >JEDIA Keyboard Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zGicznN9PgIqmg9YGshKQte_g9A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/jedia-keyboard-wrist-rest-6acf3b87508348af9841a85f283a0fa3.jpg" >JEDIA Keyboard Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KXLQPJ2?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB08KXLQPJ2" >$19 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Supportive, ergonomic memory foam</li><li>Compact and low-profile</li><li>Ventilated surface</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>More flat and narrow than most options</li><li>Simplistic design</li></ul><p> JEDIA’s unassuming but adequate keyboard wrist rest is excellent for most workplaces.

Fray-resistant stitching around the outside edges boosts its durability, while non-slip rubber on the bottom holds it on your desk.</p><p> While gaming-specific gear often comes with flashy aesthetics and premium price tags, the HyperX wrist rest sports more of a minimalist design and a reasonable cost.

Its gel feels somewhat firmer than other gel wrist rests, finding a happy medium between softness and support. It quickly bounces back into its original shape after you remove your hands, though it doesn’t hold up well to direct pressure from your elbows.</p><p> It also hits a nice balance with its cover material, which avoids the downsides of sticky plastic and absorbent fabric. The surface is smooth, satiny, and easy to wipe clean. Sizing is another aspect the 3M wrist rest gets right. Its 19-inch length works with just about any keyboard, while its narrow width and low profile make it easy to fit even in tight desk spaces.</p><p><strong>Material</strong> : Gel |<strong>No-Slip</strong> : Yes |<strong>Dimensions</strong> : 19x1.9x0.60 inches</p><h2 id="Best-for-Mechanical-Keyboards"><a href="#Best-for-Mechanical-Keyboards" class="headerlink" title="Best for Mechanical Keyboards"></a>Best for Mechanical Keyboards</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII" >Glorious Gaming Wooden Wrist Rest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRVBefu2jpU3aFTC7a5z2n-Gwrk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/glorious-gaming-wooden-wrist-rest---compact---brown---mechanical-keyboards-wood-ergonomic-palm-rest-12x4-inches19mm-thick-gv-75-brown-ece72fc9edcd4238bc03c1e73ea7443c.jpg" >Glorious Gaming Wooden Wrist Rest - Compact - Brown - Mechanical Keyboards Wood Ergonomic Palm Rest| 12x4 inches&#x2F;19mm Thick (GV-75-BROWN) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII" >https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Wood-Keyboard-Wrist-Wooden/dp/B01NBGZIII/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4172684%7Cn0787c9e2176c4ef29523c80a97ccf64a21%7CB01NBGZIII" >$30 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/glorious-wood-keyboard-wrist-rest" >View on Gloriousgaming.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Comfortable and ergonomic</li><li>Durable</li><li>Unique, elegant style</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Hard material not for everyone</li><li>On the pricey side</li></ul><p> Those preferring to type with more responsive, “clicky” physical keys can opt for a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mechanical-keyboard-2640212" >mechanical keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of a membrane keyboard that provides minimal tactile feedback.

Many products use soft memory foam padding covered with fabric. Others use a cooler, squishier gel material within a smooth surface like plastic. More rarely, you may find wrist rests with leather surfaces or made of hardwood. It often comes down to trying out a product and seeing how it feels for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Size-and-Shape"><a href="#Size-and-Shape" class="headerlink" title="Size and Shape"></a>Size and Shape</h3><p> Because a wrist rest should guide your body into a particular position, its size, and shape are essential on a functional level. A flatter wrist rest might put your hands at just the right height for your keyboard, or you may need a taller one to keep your wrists more elevated. If you use a compact keyboard or a tenkeyless (TKL) one that doesn’t include a full number pad, you might want a shorter wrist rest that matches closer to that size. Most keyboard wrist rests also work for laptops.</p><h3 id="Durability"><a href="#Durability" class="headerlink" title="Durability"></a>Durability</h3><p> It may be hard to gauge a wrist rest’s durability or how long it will last you, but generally, you’ll pay more for higher-quality construction and materials. Foam can flatten or deform, and gel pillows can be punctured. Some exterior surfaces are easier to clean and maintain than others, and some may have covers with reinforced stitching. Wooden wrist rests are as durable as they get, at the expense of softness.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>Is a keyboard wrist rest necessary?<br> While anyone can use a keyboard without one, wrist rests offer a lot of comfort and wellness benefits, especially for people who type or play computer games for long periods. Keeping your hands too high or too low, in addition to the repetitive motions, can lead to fatigue, wrist strain, and issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Wrist rests help support your wrists and keep them in a more natural position to avoid those concerns.</li><li>How do I clean my keyboard wrist rest?<br> Wrist rests can gather dirt, oils, and other stains, but fortunately, most have easy-to-clean coverings or surfaces. Gel pads with plastic or similar smooth exteriors are the simplest to wipe off with a damp cloth or sponge. Foam wrist rests tend to use covers made from fabric, which may require some vacuuming or a bit of detergent, depending on the level of dirt or staining. Generally, you should avoid washing machines and dishwashers since they usually ruin the product.</li><li>Should I choose a gel or foam keyboard wrist rest?<br> It’s a matter of preference. Memory foam wrist rests are more common—they offer soft padding that contours somewhat to the shape of your wrist, but they may stay more flattened over time. Gel wrist rests are squishy, bounce back to shape quickly, and help keep your hands cool. Some users don’t like the plastic surfaces they usually come with, though, and sharp objects may puncture and compromise the gel. If these common types don’t work for you, alternative materials like leather and wood are also available.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/7-essential-gif-creation-techniques/"><u>7 Essential GIF Creation Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/a-closer-look-at-jabra-talk-45-superior-sound-plus-powerful-performance/"><u>A Closer Look at Jabra Talk 45 - Superior Sound + Powerful Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/acer-xfa240-gaming-monitor/"><u>Acer XFA240 Gaming Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/acers-ultimate-sale-events-for-prime-day-2024-find-your-perfect-price-drop/"><u>Acer's Ultimate Sale Events for Prime Day 2024: Find Your Perfect Price Drop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/amazonbasics-flat-antenna-for-television-the-cost-effective-solution-to-access-free-local-network-channels/"><u>AmazonBasics Flat Antenna for Television: The Cost-Effective Solution to Access Free Local Network Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-sign-a-xlsx-file-document-online-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-excel-sign-a-excel/"><u>How to sign a .xlsx file document online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/ideal-mic-matches-for-dynamic-camera-use-for-2024/"><u>Ideal Mic Matches for Dynamic Camera Use for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-unmatched-visual-quality-in-the-best-4k-panels-ranked-1-10/"><u>In 2024, Unmatched Visual Quality in the Best 4K Panels, Ranked #1-10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlock-chromecast-play-any-video-format-with-ease-2023-update/"><u>New 2024 Approved Unlock Chromecast Play Any Video Format with Ease 2023 Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/speed-up-locating-your-gpu-model-on-windows-11/"><u>Speed Up: Locating Your GPU Model on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/strategies-for-apps-that-wont-download-from-play-store-on-tecno-camon-30-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Strategies for Apps That Wont Download From Play Store On Tecno Camon 30 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135396/19272" target="_top" id="2135396">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135396" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151884/7443" target="_top" id="2151884">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151884" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151884/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). Otherwise,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >Fortnite Battle Royale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is free and available on almost every major platform: PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. What’s better—cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><h2 id="Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale"><a href="#Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale"></a><strong>Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale</strong></h2><p> Battle royale games have seen a lot of shake-up in the field lately, with the latest challenger arriving in February 2019 thanks to Respawn Entertainment’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" >Apex Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play. So, if you have the time, why not try both?</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A fun, fast-paced battle royale that’s rightfully taken the world by storm.</strong></p><p> Fortnite has taken the world by storm, and with over 250 million players worldwide, it’s easy to see why it’s so beloved. If you’re a fan of campy fun, vibrant graphics, third-person shooters, or battle royale games, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is well worth a look—and best of all, it is free to play. Combined with Epic Games’ continuous ability to reinvent Fortnite season after season, Fortnite Battle Royale a sure-fire winner in our books.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Product Brand  Epic Games</li><li>Price  $29.99</li><li>PC Minimum Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel HD 4000</li><li>PC Recommended Settings  OS: Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10 64-bit, CPU: Core Core i5 2.8 Ghz, Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Mac Minimum Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i3 2.4 Ghz, Memory: 4GB RAM, GPU: Intel Iris Pro 5200</li><li>Mac Recommended Settings  OS: Mac OSX High Sierra (10.13.6+), CPU: Core i5 2.8 Ghz,Memory: 8GB RAM, GPU: Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU</li><li>Platforms  PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch</li><li>Languages Supported  English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), Turkish</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-cutting-edge-tips-refine-your-brands-instagram-visibility-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cutting-Edge Tips Refine Your Brand's Instagram Visibility for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-digital-footprint-and-interactive-iconography-honors-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Digital Footprint and Interactive Iconography Honors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-of-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-a-strategic-step-backwards/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis of the Samsung Galaxy S21: A Strategic Step Backwards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-evaluation-of-the-oneplus-similar-problem-for-theme-of-stories/"><u>Comprehensive Evaluation of the OnePlus # Similar Problem for Theme of Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/does-life360-notify-when-you-log-out-on-vivo-y27-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Vivo Y27 4G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/economical-and-efficient-an-in-depth-review-of-the-ambient-ws-2902a-osprey/"><u>Economical & Efficient: An In-Depth Review of the Ambient WS-2902A Osprey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-honor-x50i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Honor X50i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/midland-gxt1000vp4-review/"><u>Midland GXT1000VP4 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-youtube-content-as-lively-download-free-animated-gifs/"><u>Unlocking YouTube Content as Lively, Download-Free Animated GIFs</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, it will use a <a class="link"   href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/accelerate-windows-1n-1-effective-solutions-for-enhancing-system-speed-and-responsiveness/" >SATA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> connector and have a lower theoretical maximum speed than <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-troubleshoot-facebook-live-pause-strategies-for-smooth-broadcasts/" >M.2 drives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it will be cheaper.</p><p> Even if you use your SSD for gaming, not all games can benefit from faster <a class="link"   href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-total-takeover-of-powerdirector-with-our-2024-review/" >read&#x2F;write speeds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is the primary boost you’re getting from going the M.2 NVMe or PCIe route. Microsoft has also brought its <a class="link"   href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/solutions-for-when-your-steam-store-wont-load-correctly/" >DirectStorage architecture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Windows 10 and 11, so any compatible games on an NVMe drive will get a massive boost in load speeds.</p><p> So, should you go for faster speed&#x2F;write speeds if you can? That depends—will you be watching 1080p videos and playing retro or indie video games? If this is the case, the move from HDD to SSD will already provide some significant advantages, and you won’t need the additional speed.</p><p> On the other hand, if you plan to watch 4k videos, play newer video games, or run production software, faster read&#x2F;write speeds will be better for you. So if you can spend extra money to get a better read&#x2F;write speed, definitely go for it.</p><p> The only other thing you’ll want to consider is a rating called <a class="link"   href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/securing-your-documents-a-step-by-step-guide-to-password-protecting-text-files/" >terabytes written <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or TBW. This is essentially the manufacturer’s guarantee that you’ll be able to write that many terabytes to the SSD before it begins to fail.</p><p> So, for example, if an SSD has a TBW of 250, you can write 250 terabytes before it can start failing, which, throughout the standard 5-year warranty, means roughly 136GBs written to the SSD per day.</p><p> TBW ratings shouldn’t be a concern for most consumers, but as file sizes increase drastically year over year, a lower TBW isn’t that future-proof. This is why you’ll want to aim for an SSD with a size of 1TB or more since TBW is generally tied to size. For example, the median TBW for 1TB SSDs is usually around 600, while a 2TB SSD might go up to 1,200.</p><p> Of course, more space means more data that needs to be written, and therefore is it that big a difference? The answer is yes because while you likely never fill up the drive, it’s only going to cost a small amount extra to get the higher space and TBW, making it worth the price for longevity.</p><p> With that, let’s get to the best internal SSDs you can buy today.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>How Did We Research</strong></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Models Evaluated</td><td>Hours Researched</td><td>Reviews Analyzed</td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td>28</td><td>83</td></tr></tbody></table><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It’s also rated for 2,400 TBW and comes paired with a 5-year warranty, so you should be covered for a long time.</p><p> What’s interesting about the Samsung 870 EVO is that while it doesn’t do as well on copy and pasting as other SSDs, it manages to outshine quite a few when it comes to things such as booting Windows and loading games.

So, for example, when it comes to 4k, you’ll probably see around 300MB&#x2F;s on average, which is more than enough not to notice any issues while watching 4k films or shows.</p><p> You should be aware that the 970 EVO Plus does have a bit of <a class="link"   href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/leading-titles-to-unlock-on-google-play-pass-a-ranking-of-the-8-greatest-games/" >thermal throttling <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it runs for a long time, although that shouldn’t impact you on a day-to-day basis.</p><p> As for long-term endurance, the 970 EVO Plus has the industry standard with a 600 TBW and 5-year warranty. That being said, it’s rare to experience issues with modern Samsung SSDs, so it’ll be sure to last.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samsung-970-evo-plus.png"                      alt="samsung 970 evo plus"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best internal PCIe SSD</p><h5 id="Samsung-970-EVO-Plus-1"><a href="#Samsung-970-EVO-Plus-1" class="headerlink" title="Samsung 970 EVO Plus"></a>Samsung 970 EVO Plus</h5><p>With some of the best PCIe 3.0 speeds around, the 970 EVO Plus is an excellent alternative to the SX8200 Pro.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-970-EVO-Plus-MZ-V7S1T0B/dp/B07MFZY2F2?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU207523&asc_refurl=https://www.howtogeek.com/775303/best-internal-ssd/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$100 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung__970_evo_plu/6324470.p?skuId=6324470" >Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-970-evo-plus-nvme-m-2-1-tb-mz-v7s1t0b-am/" >Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="How-do-you-install-an-internal-SSD-into-a-computer"><a href="#How-do-you-install-an-internal-SSD-into-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="How do you install an internal SSD into a computer?"></a>How do you install an internal SSD into a computer?</h3><p> Internal M.2 SSDs should be fitted into a small socket on the motherboard, labeled “M.2”. The end of the SSD with the exposed contacts is pushed into the socket, with the drive held at a slightly sloped angle. When firmly inserted, the SSD can be pressed down flat and held in place with a clip or screw.</p><h3 id="Is-it-better-to-use-an-internal-or-external-SSD"><a href="#Is-it-better-to-use-an-internal-or-external-SSD" class="headerlink" title="Is it better to use an internal or external SSD?"></a>Is it better to use an internal or external SSD?</h3><p> Both internal and external SSDs have pros and cons. Internal SSDs are generally faster due to their more direct connection to the motherboard, and often better value for money. External SSDs have the benefit of being highly portable and can be used with multiple devices.</p><h3 id="What’s-the-difference-between-a-HDD-and-an-SSD"><a href="#What’s-the-difference-between-a-HDD-and-an-SSD" class="headerlink" title="What’s the difference between a HDD and an SSD?"></a>What’s the difference between a HDD and an SSD?</h3><p> HDD stands for Hard Disk Drive and refers to older optical drives with moving parts and a spinning data storage disk. SSD stands for Solid State Drive, which have no moving parts and instead store data on solid semiconductor cells.

The Fitbit app is available for both iOS and Android platforms, and syncing it to the Versa Lite via Bluetooth is very straightforward.</p><p> When you connect your watch to the app the first time, the touchscreen guides you through a series of “Quick Tips” to get you acquainted with the Versa Lite’s layout. The whole process takes about 10 minutes and then you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BD_8kRJ7n6qQdf5LY9rLKiYigTQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-05-fac178f5e6b240c29ff8d1e1e4fcb96f.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005196/22899" target="_top" id="2005196">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005196" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005196/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability"><a href="#Comfort-Attractive-and-confident-wearability" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability"></a><strong>Comfort: Attractive and confident wearability</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite feels nice in your hands and on your wrist. The device is relatively lightweight at 1.41 ounces and the screen unit sits naturally on the back of your wrist. The Versa Lite comes with two wristbands, one small and one large, measuring four and 5.25 inches long. Both are a little less than an inch wide and are made of a smooth, soft polymer material which is very comfortable for extended periods of wear.</p><p> Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed.</p><p> Aesthetically, the Versa Lite’s screen and wrist band are attractive and look sleek. You can confidently wear the Versa Lite in any professional setting—it’s good-looking but not overly flashy. Size-wise, it’s not the most ideal fitness tracker for sleep monitoring. It really feels like you are wearing a watch to bed and you might find yourself wanting to leave it on the bedside table instead.</p><h2 id="Performance-Lean-and-effective"><a href="#Performance-Lean-and-effective" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Lean and effective"></a><strong>Performance: Lean and effective</strong></h2><p> The Versa Lite uses an optical heart rate monitor which applies photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure your pulse and gauge your heart rate. This feature shines a rapidly-pulsating LED into your skin and measures how your blood flow affects the dispersion of light, producing a constant stream of heart rate data.</p><p> The Fitbit Versa Lite also has sleep monitoring features, so if you choose to sleep in the watch, the Fitbit app will be able to tell how much time you spend in light, deep, and REM stages as well as more accurately measure your resting heart rate. This is especially useful for rigorous exercise training, such as training to race a marathon or set a PR. Sleep tracking is activated by a combination of complete rest and changes in your heart rates patterns, known as heart rate variability (HRV).</p><p> Despite lacking the extra bells and whistles of Fitbit’s more advanced models (such as Fitbit Pay and music storage capabilities), the Versa Lite has all the features any walker, runner, biker, swimmer, weightlifter, or fitness enthusiast will want for goal-setting and training. It does have a few smartwatch features like a weather app and call and text notifications, as well as the Strava fitness app. But it does not have cellular connectivity on its own, and can only display notifications when connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth.</p><p> Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit.</p><p> The GPS capabilities of the Versa Lite are limited in a similar way. The smartwatch does not have full GPS capabilities, so it approximates your distance and pace by measuring your stride length with its built-in step counting technology. If you want this data to be relatively accurate, you’ll have to take your phone along with you so the watch can use what Fitbit calls “connected GPS” to access your smartphone’s GPS signal. Without connected GPS, our testing found that the pace data was less accurate and varied quite a bit compared to the data our other GPS-capable watches collected.</p><p> The Versa Lite has specific modes for running, biking, swimming, walking, treadmill workouts, weight lifting, and interval workouts. These exercise apps chart your workouts and allow you to customize a real-time display of your stats in order to get you the updates you want in the middle of your workout. For instance, the Versa Lite can notify you at predetermined ‘lap’ distances (such as mile intervals) to give you your average mile pace while in “Run” or “Walk” mode. You can easily customize these different stats in the exercise app settings.</p><p> The Versa Lite is water-resistant and rated at a depth of 50 meters, so you can swim with it on and take advantage of its swim mode exercise app. The swimming app brings up one of the flaws we found with our particular Versa Lite: it wouldn’t turn off! There are recent reports on the Fitbit.com forum of some users encountering a strange phenomenon where the swim mode won’t stop when you press the pause and finish buttons.</p><p> It is unclear how many users are affected by this glitch (it seems other users are unaffected) but we experienced it with the Versa Lite Edition we tested. The only way for us to exit the swim exercise app was to hold down the side button for about 10 seconds in order to escape with the factory power cycle feature. This was one of the only significant flaws we found with the Versa Lite, but it did mean that all data for the swim workout was lost after restarting the Fitbit. This essentially rendered the swim mode unusable on our unit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/97XADSG__Ti-9y6W9YfT6A-sRLg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-04-a5baf62c5de749cb93986be2eab3ad2d.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134235/18498" target="_top" id="2134235">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134235" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134235/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Battery-Life-Days-of-activity"><a href="#Battery-Life-Days-of-activity" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life: Days of activity"></a><strong>Battery Life: Days of activity</strong></h2><p> Fitbit promised four or more days of battery life for the Versa Lite, and they weren’t lying. The Versa Lite we tested lasted almost four and a half days before draining all the way down to zero. This made so many days of daily wear and daily runs seem hassle-free.</p><p> It also charged back up to 100% in just about two hours—for a device that gives you a range of stats, this speedy battery top-up means the fitness freaks among us won’t have to sacrifice too much time away from our metrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NkHZ0M514IlrqowHF6M_QWHxgj8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4057119-06-be4c149f1dff4214acfe0fbc3a4d63e6-1-f6f110eb54e142c992dd3f613bdb9f28.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Versa Lite"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Key-Features-Fitbit-basics-plus-apps-for-any-activity"><a href="#Key-Features-Fitbit-basics-plus-apps-for-any-activity" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: Fitbit basics plus apps for any activity"></a><strong>Key Features: Fitbit basics plus apps for any activity</strong></h2><p> Like all Fitbits, the Versa Lite keeps track of what the company calls their “Fitbit basics.” These are key activity metrics for any active lifestyle and make it super easy for you to keep track of your health and get motivated.</p><p> The Fitbit basics have their own section on the Versa Lite, separate from the other apps, and they show you what you’ve accomplished for the day. These stats include daily step count, total distance covered for the day, daily calorie consumption, active minutes for each day, and a Saturday through Friday graph of your average daily steps.</p><p> A host of other smartwatch apps come standard with the Versa Lite, including alarms, a weather app, a stopwatch, a relaxation app that guides you through short mindfulness exercises, and the specific exercise apps mentioned above. As far as additional apps for the Versa Lite, this is it—the Lite Edition does not have the ability to add extra apps.</p><h2 id="Price-A-deal-for-under-200"><a href="#Price-A-deal-for-under-200" class="headerlink" title="Price: A deal for under $200"></a><strong>Price: A deal for under $200</strong></h2><p> Retailing for $159.95 and occasionally selling for less on sale, the Versa Lite is a price-conscious but solid piece of tech that prioritizes exercise. It’s a great introduction to the smartwatch lifestyle with all the notifications you need to be connected and without an overwhelming amount of distractions.</p><p> The ability to train in-depth with the Fitbit app and various Versa Lite exercise apps makes this fitness tracker a pretty good deal for under $200. Avid swimmers, on the other hand, may want to look elsewhere.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135351/19272" target="_top" id="2135351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Fitbit-Versa-Lite-Edition-vs-Apple-Watch-Series-4"><a href="#Fitbit-Versa-Lite-Edition-vs-Apple-Watch-Series-4" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Versa Lite Edition vs. Apple Watch Series 4"></a><strong>Fitbit Versa Lite Edition vs. Apple Watch Series 4</strong></h2><p> Fitbit and Apple have fundamentally different business models, but one thing is certain: the Fitbit Versa Lite wins in the price category and accomplishes all the key health monitoring features of the Apple Watch Series 4.</p><p> The Versa Lite, and the Versa family in general, are Fitbit’s main venture into the smartwatch market. Relying heavily on the Fitbit app for its design and integration, the Versa Lite is focused on delivering a targeted dashboard of stats for its users, including Fitbit’s core stats like step counting and calorie counting.</p><p> The new Apple Watch on the other hand, as per Apple’s brand identity, is more geared to synchronizing and integrating with the lives, apps, and products of those already accustomed to the iPhone and Mac brand. In addition to this, Apple’s new Series 4 watches have been redesigned with wellness monitoring features like heart rate tracking and step counting.</p><p> The Apple Watch carries a heftier price tag at $399 (MSRP) without cellular connectivity. If you are not already hooked on the Mac lifestyle or love to accessorize your digital life with apps, the Fitbit Versa Lite should be a worthy consideration for anyone looking to get a quality fitness tracker and well made first-tier smartwatch.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An adept and affordable fitness tracking smartwatch for those who want to keep it simple.</strong></p><p> Though we can’t recommend this watch to swimmers (pending a potential software solution for that glitch), the Fitbit Versa Lite is a great way to chart your progress throughout a training program or competitive season. The combination of the Fitbit Basics and dedicated exercise apps makes this watch both an insightful wellness monitor for everyday activity and a great tool for tracking your fitness progress.</p><h3

This usually manifests in things like poor battery life, low quality screens, and other concessions.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >Acer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has managed to defy that stereotype with the Aspire E 15, which smashes the competition in terms of performance, display quality, battery life, and even includes a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-vga-2626027" >VGA port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for anyone who actually needs one of those.</p><p> We put an Acer Aspire E 15 to the test around the office and out in the world to see how it holds up outside of basic benchmarks.

It also tips the scales at over five pounds, which is definitely on the heavy side for a 15.6” laptop.</p><p> The body, lid, and bezel are all plastic, which feels a bit cheap to the touch. But it does have a pleasant brushed pattern that breaks the monotony of the basic black case, and the interior deck features a textured metallic finish that looks and feels significantly better than the rest of the laptop.</p><p> On the right side of the Aspire E 15, you’ll find the power jack, headphone jack, a USB 2.0 port, and a DVD burner. The SD card reader is located on the front of the device, alongside the LED indicator lights. On the left side is the VGA port that Acer still loves to throw on everything, an HDMI port, two USB 3.0 ports, an ethernet jack, and a USB port.</p><p>Aesthetics may be the Acer Aspire E 15’s weakest area.</p><p> The keyboard is roomy and comfortable and the keys feel sharp and springy. The trackpad is massive and responsive, but it doesn’t feel as robust as the keyboard. The left and right buttons are incorporated into the main body of the trackpad, and they have far too much give—if we pressed down with more than the absolute minimum necessary force, it felt like the trackpad might collapse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove"><a href="#Setup-Process-A-ton-of-bloatware-to-remove" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: A ton of bloatware to remove"></a><strong>Setup Process:</strong> <strong>A ton of bloatware to remove</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217" >Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> preloaded, and the setup process isn’t really anything out of the ordinary for a Windows 10 laptop. Acer requests some contact information during the initial setup, which is something that most of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-oem-software-1701736" >OEMs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do to help with warranties and support. We timed the process from start to finish, and it took about 10 minutes to go from plugging it in and turning it on, to hitting the desktop for the first time.</p><p> Once you finish the initial setup, most users will also want to take additional time to remove the substantial amount of bloatware that comes preinstalled. This isn’t necessary but is something that most users will probably want to do, and it does add quite a bit of time to the setup process if you opt to go that route.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M-q3UXEJ6htBtTcwPWAH9SLwJeI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-4-1cfdfcc543fa4eb5b5e5449b6ea37413.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color"><a href="#Display-Full-HD-display-with-awesome-contrast-but-washed-out-color" class="headerlink" title="Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color"></a><strong>Display: Full HD display with awesome contrast but washed-out color</strong></h2><p> While the Aspire E 15’s screen isn’t the brightest or most colorful in the world, it is a full HD display that absolutely shines compared to the low-resolution screens found on a lot of laptops in this category.</p><p> The display has decent viewing angles and great contrast, but the colors are a bit washed out. It’s fine for watching videos on YouTube and Netflix—and DVDs, of course—but it wouldn’t be our first choice for movie night. It’s definitely a display that’s best suited for work, with media and gaming as afterthoughts.</p><h2 id="Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD"><a href="#Performance-Outperforms-the-competition-but-suffers-from-a-slow-HDD" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD"></a><strong>Performance: Outperforms the competition, but suffers from a slow HDD</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 suffers a bit from a slow hard drive, and it could stand to have a bit more RAM, but it performs exceedingly well for a laptop in this category. It beats most of the competition in all important benchmarks and is a joy to use for productivity tasks, web browsing, and even light<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-laptops-under-1000-4148125" >gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 is available in two basic configurations. The unit we tested was the less expensive of the two, featuring an Intel Core i3-8130U running at 2.2 GHz, an Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU, and 6GB DDR3L RAM. The more expensive configuration comes with a Core i7 processor, a discrete<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161" >Nvidia graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , more RAM, and an SSD, so it performs even better.</p><p> We ran the PCMark 10 benchmark, and the Aspire E 15 recorded an overall score of 2,657. It did best in the essentials category, with a score of 5,097, and slightly worse in productivity and digital content creation with scores of 4,534 and 2,203 respectively. In comparison, the similarly-priced Lenovo Ideapad 320 managed an overall score of just 1,062.</p><p> The full HD screen and snappy performance make productivity tasks a breeze.</p><p> So how does that score translate into the real world? It means the Aspire E 15 opens apps without a lot of lag, is capable of multitasking without bogging down, and can juggle more than a dozen web browser windows without skipping a beat, even if you’re streaming video.</p><p> We also ran a few gaming benchmarks from 3DMark, with slightly less stellar results. The first one we tried was Fire Strike, which is designed for gaming laptops. It only managed a score of 855 in that benchmark, running at just 4 FPS during the graphics test and 17 FPS during the physics test.</p><p> That was significantly better than other laptops we tested in this category, but the integrated Intel UHD Graphics 620 GPU was definitely a bottleneck.</p><p> We also ran the Cloud Gate benchmark, which is designed for low end desktops and basic laptops. That resulted in a score of 6,492 at 36 FPS, indicating that the Aspire E 15 is capable of basic gaming.</p><p> Next up, we installed Steam and fired up Capcom’s blockbuster hit Monster Hunter for a true torture test. Astoundingly, the game was almost playable. It took forever to load into Astera due to the slow HDD, but we set out on a short expedition anyway. The game ran at between 20 and 30 FPS the whole time, but found that the action really bogged down with a big monster on the screen.</p><p> The takeaway is that we absolutely wouldn’t recommend buying this laptop for the purpose of playing games, but it is capable of rising to the task if you’re willing to lower the settings and stick to older games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137973/21526" target="_top" id="2137973">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137973" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137973/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go"><a href="#Productivity-Gets-the-job-done-at-work-home-or-on-the-go" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go"></a><strong>Productivity: Gets the job done at work, home, or on the go</strong></h2><p> The Aspire E 15 is designed with productivity in mind.

You won’t have to wait around every time you want to load or switch between apps. The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, which is great for long typing sessions, and the fantastic battery life means that you can unplug for an entire work or school day without worrying about power.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0j4qIM8N-IXUlX66rWrHmqZTjxQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1lW4043278-Acer-Aspire-3-8bdb945a491f4f4cbab64c65fa21d9af.jpg"                      alt="Acer Aspire E 15"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Audio-Decent-speakers-but-no-bass-response"><a href="#Audio-Decent-speakers-but-no-bass-response" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Decent speakers, but no bass response"></a><strong>Audio: Decent speakers, but no bass response</strong></h2><p> The speakers are decent enough, but the audio quality is still one of the Aspire E 15’s weaker points. They just don’t get all that loud, and when we did crank the volume all the way up, we noticed a bit of distortion in some frequency ranges. There isn’t a whole lot of bass, either, so everything sounds a little tinny—and that only gets worse at louder volumes.</p><p> Strangely enough, the audio is actually louder and clearer when the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/14-16-inch-laptops-833846" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is sitting on a flat surface. It seems like there is a lot of sound escaping from the vents as well as through the actual speaker grills, and placing it on a solid surface seems to improve the audio quality.</p><h2 id="Network-Great-speeds-on-both-5-GHz-and-2-4-GHz-networks"><a href="#Network-Great-speeds-on-both-5-GHz-and-2-4-GHz-networks" class="headerlink" title="Network: Great speeds on both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz networks"></a><strong>Network: Great speeds on both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz networks</strong></h2><p> The Aspire E 15 includes a wireless card that’s capable of connecting to both 2.4 and 5 GHz wireless networks, which is a nice touch if you have a wireless router that lets you take advantage of this feature. 2.4 and 5 GHz network compatibility is standard on more expensive laptops, but a lot of competitors in the budget category leave it out.</p><p> Acer advertises a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be a pretty accurate claim.</p><p> We found that the Aspire E 15 was able to achieve download speeds of 260 Mbps and upload speeds of 65 Mbps when connected to our 5 GHz network.

Acer advertises a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be a pretty accurate claim.</p><p> Under ideal conditions (and with extremely light use) we found that the battery lasted about 14 hours in our testing. You’re unlikely to achieve this in everyday scenarios, but that’s the baseline maximum you could expect it to last.</p><p> Subjected to normal levels of use—constantly on with the brightness lowered and power management set to favor battery life—we found that the battery lasts about eight and a half hours. With similar settings, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a full day of work or school out of this laptop.</p><p> In a category where a lot of competing devices die out after four or five hours, that’s pretty remarkable.</p><h2 id="Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware"><a href="#Software-Bogged-down-by-bloatware" class="headerlink" title="Software: Bogged down by bloatware"></a><strong>Software: Bogged down by bloatware</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 comes with Windows 10, some basic Windows apps, and a free trial of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-install-office-365-4589808" >Microsoft 365 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It also comes with a whole bunch of bloatware from Acer, Netflix, Evernote, an outdated version of Firefox, and several games you probably won’t want or need.</p><p> If you’re a Firefox user, it might be nice to have that already downloaded (just remember to update it immediately). But the rest of this bloatware is most likely going to be an annoyance that needs to get uninstalled.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Extremely-competitive-pricing"><a href="#Price-Extremely-competitive-pricing" class="headerlink" title="Price: Extremely competitive pricing"></a><strong>Price: Extremely competitive pricing</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of just $380, the Aspire E 15 is a fantastic deal. If you can get it for even less than that, then it’s truly a steal. The more expensive configuration with an SSD, discrete graphics, and Core i7, is also a good deal at an MSRP of $599 if you have a little more room in your budget.</p><h2 id="Competition-Blows-the-competition-out-of-the-water-in-almost-every-category"><a href="#Competition-Blows-the-competition-out-of-the-water-in-almost-every-category" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Blows the competition out of the water in almost every category"></a><strong>Competition: Blows the competition out of the water in almost every category</strong></h2><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 beats most of the competition in its price range thanks to superior hardware. It has a full HD screen, where competitors like the HP Notebook 15 and Lenovo Ideapad 320, priced at $288 and $299 respectively, both have 1366 x 768 displays. The Aspire E 15 also has more RAM than either of those laptops, a better CPU, and faster Wi-Fi speeds.</p><p> The Aspire E 15 also beats the competition, hands down, in battery life. While the Aspire E 15 can last for 12 hours, the HP Notebook 15 and Ideapad 320 both putter out at around the five-hour mark.</p><p> One thing the Aspire E 15 doesn’t have is a touchscreen, which can be found in some budget laptops. For example, the HP 15-BS013DX is priced in the sub-$500 category, and it includes a touchscreen.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-notebook-15-review-4686698" >HP Notebook 15 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Worth buying (and spending extra for the upgraded version if you can).</strong></p><p> The Acer Aspire E 15 hits almost all the right notes while keeping the price way, way down. If you have a little room in your budget, it’s worth investing in the more expensive configuration of this laptop, which comes with a discrete NVIDIA graphics card for gaming, extra RAM, and a speedy SSD.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-chromebook-c202sa-review-4589359" >Asus Chromebook C202SA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-ideapad-320-review-4686723" >Lenovo Ideapad 320 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Aspire E 15</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>SKU  E5-576-392H</li><li>Price  $329.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  15 x 10.2 x 1.19 in.</li><li>Storage  1 TB HDD</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i3-8130U, 2.2 GHz</li><li>Compatibility  Windows</li><li>RAM  6GB DDR3L</li><li>Camera  0.9 MP webcam</li><li>Display  15.6” 1920 x 1080</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-craft-compelling-videos-utilize-no-cost-templates-and-samples/"><u>2024 Approved Craft Compelling Videos Utilize No-Cost Templates & Samples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-manuals.techidaily.com/abbyy-digital-identity-verification-enters-the-french-market/"><u>ABBYY Digital Identity Verification Enters the French Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/demystifying-turings-evaluation-chances-of-victory/"><u>Demystifying Turing's Evaluation: Chances of Victory?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/digital-detox-diaries-what-instagrams-advice-to-unplug-reveals/"><u>Digital Detox Diaries: What Instagram's Advice to Unplug Reveals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/elevate-your-content-perfecting-videos-on-instagram/"><u>Elevate Your Content Perfecting Videos on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-poco-m6-5g-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Screen Mirroring Poco M6 5G to PC?

You may be hearing more about<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —the next generation of Wi-Fi that can help improve data flow on crowded networks, and even promote improved battery efficiency on your connected devices. Most Wi-Fi 6 routers are still pretty expensive, with prices hovering in the $250 to $500 (plus) range. The TP-Link Archer AX600 is priced in the lower range, but it still has an impressive spec list, including smart home compatibility, multiple ports, powerful hardware, and some of the latest and greatest features. I tested the TP-Link Archer AX6000 to see how the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >long range router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> performs in the real world.</p><h2 id="Design-Multiple-antennas"><a href="#Design-Multiple-antennas" class="headerlink" title="Design: Multiple antennas"></a><strong>Design: Multiple antennas</strong></h2><p> The TP-Link Archer isn’t exactly a showstopper, but it’s reasonably attractive. It’s all black, square-shaped, and it has a significant amount of venting along the top. The unit resembles an upside down spider when it’s antennas are in the up position. The router is on the larger side, but it doesn’t look too bulky or obtrusive. It’s a 10.3 inch by 10.3 inch square, and the antennas swing out from the sides. The antennas only adjust 90 degrees, from flat to upwards, and you can’t adjust them multi-directionally.</p><p> TP-Link managed to pack a lot into the AX6000’s housing. The main indicator light sits on top, positioned smack dab in the middle of the router. On the back, there’s a power button, power supply port, eight<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ethernet-3426740" >LAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383" >WAN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port, and the reset button. The remaining tiny button controls sit along the front face, and two additional ports (a USB-A and USB-C port) sit along the side perimeter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oZZbi3TrOFsKJpFR_Hq5AKVQoeI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_LongRangeRouters_ArcherAX600_04-e71302c6fd7a4ea89baeab29b1b7ea35.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer AX6000"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918666/19272" target="_top" id="1918666">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918666" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918666/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Quick-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Quick-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Quick and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Quick and easy</strong></h2><p> The setup process took about five minutes. You can use the TP Link portal, or you can use the Tether app on your mobile device. There’s a QR code in the quick start guide, so you can find the app, or you can just search for it in the App Store. Once you download the app, you just click the + button to add a device, select Archer AX6000, and follow the prompts.</p><p> I created a separate 2.4 and 5 GHz network, but there’s also a smart connect option where you can have the system assign a network band based on optimal performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139121/17108" target="_top" id="2139121">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139121" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139121/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-8-streams-and-Wi-Fi-6"><a href="#Connectivity-8-streams-and-Wi-Fi-6" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: 8 streams and Wi-Fi 6"></a><strong>Connectivity: 8 streams and Wi-Fi 6</strong></h2><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> TP-Link Archer AX6000 has a max speed of 4804 Mbps over 5 GHz and 1148 Mbps over 2.4 GHz. It’s unlikely you’ll actually see speeds this fast, as these speeds indicate what the router is capable of in the perfect environment with blazing fast provider speeds and maxed out equipment.</p><p> For wired devices, the AX6000 has plenty of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —more than the Nighthawk RAX120.

On an Wi-Fi 6 compatible phone, the AX6000 clocked 483 Mbps while standing five feet away from the router. When I traveled to the opposite end of my 1,600 square foot test home to a room where I usually experience dead zones, the speed dropped to 442 Mbps.</p><p> I also tested speeds on a device that isn’t Wi-Fi 6 compatible, a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-ideapad-laptop-review-4843583" >budget IdeaPad laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . I used the smart connect feature, allowing the router to decide which band was optimal. Standing right next to the router, the speed clocked in at 398 Mbps. In my “dead zone room,” where I typically experience drop offs, the speed dropped, but still came in at a respectable 351 Mbps. This is the fastest router I’ve ever tested.</p><p> From the moment I connected the Archer AX6000, I didn’t experience any dead zones or connection issues on any of the devices in my test home. I have a large backyard, and even in the back corner, I can still get a clear connection on my laptop. The Archer AX6000 provided a fast, stable, buffer-free connection even when running multiple gaming and streaming media devices. I had no problem running a gaming PC, two PlayStations, and two FireTVs simultaneously.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OTd5mhn2AJiGFS4wy6ji5VGG3RI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_LongRangeRouters_ArcherAX600_06-2e1fbc3e239449b8b604f1dbe46ba522.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer AX6000"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135414/19272" target="_top" id="2135414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135414/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Key-features-TP-Link-HomeCare"><a href="#Key-features-TP-Link-HomeCare" class="headerlink" title="Key features: TP-Link HomeCare"></a><strong>Key features: TP-Link HomeCare</strong></h2><p> Under the hood, the AX6000 boasts a 1.8 GHz quad-core CPU, 1 GB of RAM, and 128 MB flash memory. Because the Archer AX6000 is a Wi-Fi 6 router, it includes advanced technologies like OFDMA that promote a faster and more efficient network. Beamforming technology gives it the ability to concentrate Wi-Fi signals on the devices that matter to you most, while range boost allows the signal to travel farther. Upon its release, the Archer AX6000 was still awaiting WPA3 encryption, but the company says in its website that WPA3 should be coming soon.</p><p> The AX6000 has a USB-A and a USB-C port, so you can connect an external hard drive and share files across your network. It’s also compatible with Alexa and IFTTT, so you can use voice commands to control your router. You can say things like, “Alexa, pause PlayStation for 30 minutes,” or “Alexa, ask TP-Link to enable guest network.”</p><p> There’s also a smart connect option where you can have the system assign a network band based on optimal performance.</p><h2 id="Software-TP-Link-Tether-app"><a href="#Software-TP-Link-Tether-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: TP-Link Tether app"></a><strong>Software: TP-Link Tether app</strong></h2><p> You can manage your network remotely via the Tether app. You can manage devices—block specific devices, set priority, and set parental controls for individual devices or groups of devices. The app also includes HomeCare, a collection of features that promote a fast, stable, and safe network. You can set parental controls, turn on antivirus protection, and prioritize online activity for streaming, gaming, web surfing, and more. There’s a speed test feature powered by Ookla directly in the app, as well as other tools for managing your network.</p><p> The app is a trimmed down version of what’s on the website, so you can’t access all of the features on the app. The app will direct you to the TP-Link site for certain features like setting up a VPN, IPv6 creation, and NAT forwarding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nvCBXy0UZFrdTurT8MquKGraCio=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_LongRangeRouters_ArcherAX600_03-8432bc3fbbbf492ba9889bf29a459435.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer AX6000"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad"><a href="#Price-Not-bad" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad"></a><strong>Price: Not bad</strong></h2><p> The TP Link Archer AX6000 typically sells for $300.

They’re both dual-band Wi-Fi 6 routers, and they boast many of the same technologies like OFDMA, beamforming, and smart connect. They both have quad-core processors, except the Nighthawk’s processor is 2.2 GHz, and the TP-Link Archer only has a 1.8 GHz CPU. The Nighthawk AX12 is a 12-stream router (compared to eight streams for the Archer), and the Nighthawk features the WPA3 security protocol, while the Archer AX6000 does not yet have WPA3.</p><p> The Nighthawk AX12 is about $100 more than the Archer AX6000, and the AX12 has some better specs than the TP-Link. But, in spite of its lower price point, the TP-Link outshines the Nighthawk in a few areas. TP-Link Archer AX6000 has more Ethernet ports, includes antivirus protection, and has better integration with smart home platforms. In my test home, the TP-Link Archer AX6000 clocked slightly faster speeds than the Nighthawk AX12.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>One of the fastest routers in its price range.</strong></p><p> The TP-Link Archer AX6000 can handle pretty much anything you throw at it.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Archer AX6000 8-Stream Wi-Fi 6 Router</li><li>Product Brand  TP-Link</li><li>SKU  845973099763</li><li>Price  $400.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  10.3 x 10.3 x 2.4 in.</li><li>Encryption type  WPA, WPA2, WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK</li><li>Warranty  2 years</li><li>Firewall type  SPI</li><li>OFDMA  Yes</li><li>Number of Atennas  8</li><li>Number of Bands  2</li><li>Number of LAN Ports  8</li><li>Additional Ports  USB type C, USB type A</li><li>WAN port  2.5 Gbps</li><li>Processor  1.8 GHz Quad-Core CPU</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-full-insight-gecata-game-logging-system-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Full Insight Gecata Game Logging System Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-break-the-ice-how-to-make-a-hit-youtube-reaction-in-just-15-minutes-or-less/"><u>2024 Approved Break the Ice - How to Make a Hit YouTube Reaction in Just 15 Minutes or Less</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-clarity-in-low-quality-facebook-streams/"><u>2024 Approved Enhancing Clarity in Low-Quality Facebook Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-cloud.techidaily.com/copycat-convenience-the-ultimate-guide-to-using-the-mirror-folder-feature-on-windows-11/"><u>Copycat Convenience: The Ultimate Guide to Using the Mirror Folder Feature on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/from-looks-to-wallet-impact-evaluating-the-motorola-one-as-an-economical-iphone-counterpart/"><u>From Looks to Wallet Impact - Evaluating the Motorola One as an Economical iPhone Counterpart</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/how-the-kobo-nia-holds-its-ground-against-amazons-kindle-expert-opinions-and-insights/"><u>How the Kobo Nia Holds Its Ground Against Amazon's Kindle - Expert Opinions & Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-master-tracking-your-stuff-expert-review-of-the-apple-airtag-for-iphone-users/"><u>How to Master Tracking Your Stuff: Expert Review of the Apple AirTag for iPhone Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-rectify-unmovable-scrolling-in-excel-windows/"><u>How to Rectify Unmovable Scrolling in Excel (Windows)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-audio-functionality-in-windows/"><u>How to Restore Audio Functionality in Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-your-nubia-red-magic-8s-proplus-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset your Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ Lock Screen Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-tailoring-textual-terminals/"><u>In 2024, Tailoring Textual Terminals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-and-review-of-netgears-ac1200-wireless-range-expander-ex6200/"><u>In-Depth Analysis and Review of Netgear's AC1200 Wireless Range Expander EX6200</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-guide-to-microsoft-surface-ergonomic-keyboard-unpacking-its-superior-quality/"><u>In-Depth Guide to Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard – Unpacking Its Superior Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-exclusive.techidaily.com/tutorial-recuperation-des-sauvegardes-de-serveur-windows-server-dans-un-environnement-virtuel/"><u>Tutorial : Récupération Des Sauvegardes De Serveur Windows Server Dans Un Environnement Virtuel</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that generally try to provide content for every viewer, specialty services aren’t interested in pleasing a broad audience. As such, the main thing to consider when finding a specialty streaming service is what kind of content you’re looking for.</p><p> Pretty much every genre of movie and TV series is available in some form on <a class="link"   href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-audio-ambassadors-where-to-find-legal-skype-ringtone-files/" >Netflix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, but there may only be a handful of options for your favorite type of programming. Once you identify what you’re missing on those services, you can look for an additional niche offering to supplement them.</p><p> Or maybe you have no interest in the mainstream entertainment offered by major streaming services, and you want to start by honing in on your favorite niche, whether that’s a genre, an era of filmmaking, or a specific global region.</p><p> There’s no need to spend money on popular streaming services that don’t offer the content you’re looking for, and most specialty services charge cheaper monthly fees than their big-name counterparts. You can save by sticking with just a few specialty services if you only enjoy specific media genres.</p><p> Whether you rely on them as your primary source for entertainment or as supplements to more extensive services, it’s unlikely that you’ll want to subscribe to more than one or two specialty streaming services. These services aren’t for everyone, and that’s precisely the point.</p><p> Our picks will help guide you to the exact service for your unique interests.</p><p> How-To Geek’s product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

Horror fans are known for the service’s dedication to the genre, even to productions that might be considered questionable to mainstream audiences.</p><p> But that’s what’s great about Shudder—it doesn’t take the <a class="link"   href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/55552/31-horror-movies-to-watch-in-october/" >horror audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for granted. Sure, there are well-known horror classics and weird cult favorites available to stream, but Shudder is also dedicated to bringing its audience new discoveries and unlikely picks from the horror vaults.</p><p> Shudder’s slate of original and exclusive films has become the premier destination for independent, creative horror, and the service has increased its frequency of originals and exclusives over time. In addition to movies, Shudder features select original series, including its series revival of the Stephen King&#x2F;George Romero anthology Creepshow.</p><p> The service also offers themed live-stream channels of films from its library for viewers who can’t decide what to watch. Shudder even features occasional live-stream marathons hosted by icons of the horror community like Joe Bob Briggs and Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.</p><p> Shudder’s curation is one of its main strengths, but it involves removing and adding new movies. As a result, the service’s library grows slowly, with many films often expiring or being removed. Still, if you can’t find your favorite horror movie to watch, you can count on Shudder’s expert programming team to offer you something just as good or even better.</p><p> Plans come in two sizes: monthly ($5.99&#x2F;month) and annual ($56.99&#x2F;year, $4.75&#x2F;month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shudder-logo.jpg"                      alt="shudder-logo"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Streaming Service for Horror</p><h5 id="shudder-1"><a href="#shudder-1" class="headerlink" title="shudder"></a>shudder</h5><p>Shudder is the place for horror fans, featuring a carefully curated selection of classic and recent horror films, plus original and exclusive programming and partnerships with horror personalities.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.shudder.com/" >Shudder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Streaming-Service-for-Classic-Cinema-The-Criterion-Channel"><a href="#Best-Streaming-Service-for-Classic-Cinema-The-Criterion-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Best Streaming Service for Classic Cinema: The Criterion Channel"></a>Best Streaming Service for Classic Cinema: <a class="link"   href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/" >The Criterion Channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/criterion-channel.jpg"                      alt="criterion channel banner"                > Criterion</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Expertly selected collections of classic and influential films from around the world</td><td>✗ Titles come and go frequently</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Extensive bonus materials</td><td>✗ Higher price than most specialty services</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Helpful guidance on what to watch</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Since 1984, Criterion has been the most trusted brand name for curating classic and acclaimed cinema on home video, from laserdisc to DVD to Blu-ray. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/" >Criterion Channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> brings that same standard to a streaming service.</p><p> This streaming service isn’t just an endless list of titles to scroll through. It’s a thoughtfully programmed lineup of themed sets of movies, many of them augmented by the kind of extensive bonus material that’s still a hallmark of Criterion’s home releases. That means you can listen to feature-length commentary and watch supplemental interviews for many of the movies on Criterion.</p><p> Criterion’s definition of classic cinema is expansive, encompassing vintage Hollywood and movies from around the world, underground and experimental cinema, and even select new releases. The themed collections make it easy to hone in on what interests you or explore a new area of cinema.</p><p> These extras are costly, though, and Criterion’s price ($11 per month or $100 per year) is higher than most specialty services. To offer content from so many different sources, some of which are subject to complicated rights issues, Criterion also cycles through its catalog fairly quickly, and dozens of movies leave the service at the end of each month.</p><p> But there is more than enough at any given time to satisfy even the most discerning cinephile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/criterion-channel.jpg"                      alt="criterion-channel"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Streaming Service for Classic Cinema</p><h5 id="The-Criterion-Channel-1"><a href="#The-Criterion-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="The Criterion Channel"></a>The Criterion Channel</h5><p>The Criterion Channel brings the prestige and care of the Criterion Collection to a streaming service, featuring expertly selected lineups of classic cinema, along with extensive bonus features.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/" >Criterion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043662/7443" target="_top" id="2043662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043662/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Streaming-Service-for-British-International-TV-Acorn-TV"><a href="#Best-Streaming-Service-for-British-International-TV-Acorn-TV" class="headerlink" title="Best Streaming Service for British&#x2F;International TV: Acorn TV"></a>Best Streaming Service for British&#x2F;International TV: <a class="link"   href="https://acorn.tv/" >Acorn TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://acorn.tv/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://acorn.tv/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/acorn-tv.png"                      alt="Acorn TV homepage"                > Acorn TV</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://acorn.tv/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Extensive library of series from the U.K. and other countries</td><td>✗ International selection focused primarily on Europe</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Multiple seasons of vintage shows</td><td>✗ Minimal movie content</td></tr><tr><td>✓ New premieres close to overseas release dates</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> There was a time when British TV series only made it to the U.S. via PBS stations, but one of the great things about the age of streaming is that it’s made international TV much more accessible. Major streaming services all feature a selection of shows from around the world, but for hardcore British and European TV fans, the selection is still relatively limited.</p><p> That’s where <a class="link"   href="https://acorn.tv/" >Acorn TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes in. You won’t find any American-produced shows here, but you will find a wide range of shows from the United Kingdom and other countries, from beloved classics to new releases.</p><p> Maybe you remember growing up with dramas like Midsomer Murders or Poirot on PBS, or perhaps you’re curious about cult British comedies like Detectorists or Only Fools and Horses. Maybe you want to be among the first American viewers to catch the latest Scandinavian murder drama. Acorn is the place for all that, with a library of British TV staples and new productions from the U.K., Europe, Canada, and Australia.</p><p> The international scope of Acorn sticks mainly to English-speaking countries and mainland Europe, so if you’re interested in shows from <a class="link"   href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-charting-new-pathways-in-art-an-exclusive-look-at-the-top-10-low-cost-creator-platforms-on-youtube/" >South America <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Asia, you won’t find them here. Acorn is almost entirely TV-focused, with only a smattering of feature films that sometimes seem like they were selected randomly.</p><p> However, that still leaves tons of content for fans eager to explore TV from across the pond. So if you’re a fan of British or European TV, Acorn TV is the subscription to get. The month-to-month plan costs $6.99, and the annual membership comes with a price tag of $69.99.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/acorn-tv.jpg"                      alt="acorn-tv"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Streaming Service for British&#x2F;International TV</p><h5 id="Acorn-TV-1"><a href="#Acorn-TV-1" class="headerlink" title="Acorn TV"></a>Acorn TV</h5><p>Acorn TV caters to Anglophiles with classic and recent British TV series, plus international shows and some movies from English-speaking countries and mainland Europe.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://acorn.tv/" >Acorn TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Streaming-Service-for-Anime-Crunchyroll"><a href="#Best-Streaming-Service-for-Anime-Crunchyroll" class="headerlink" title="Best Streaming Service for Anime: Crunchyroll"></a>Best Streaming Service for Anime: <a class="link"   href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" >Crunchyroll <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Crunchyroll.jpg"                      alt="Person holding remote near crunchyroll icon"                ></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/july-1-2021-brazil-this-photo-2000548499" >rafapress&#x2F;Shutterstock.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ World’s largest selection of anime</td><td>✗ Uncertainty over new ownership</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Free ad-supported tier available</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>✓ Non-anime content including live-action programs and manga</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Japanese animation, or anime, has had an American following for decades, with periodic mainstream breakthroughs like Akira or the films of <a class="link"   href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-shielding-your-media-what-does-unlisted-mean-in-youtube/" >Studio Ghibli <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Best of all, it’s done so while remaining free, with most users taking advantage of the free ad-supported version. For viewers who want to forgo commercials, premium subscriptions are available starting at $8 per month.</p><p> The service has become such a power player that it’s been the subject of several corporate acquisitions, and in late 2020 <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/att-sells-crunchyroll-to-sony/" >it was acquired by Sony <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, owner of rival anime service Funimation.

Since its launch as PrendeTV in 2021, and following a re-brand a year later, ViX has gained many millions of subscribers to its free and premium packages. And if you want content from the Spanish-speaking parts of the world, it’s easy to see why.</p><p> ViX mainly features TV content from Univision and free-to-air channels such as Las Estrellas, Canal 5, Canal 9, and Foro, but tops up that offering with movies, news, and sports from several Spanish-speaking regions. Its recent acquisition of the popular Pantaya service, which gained it the exclusive rights to air many popular Latin American novellas and series, adds to the appeal.</p><p> The free package offered by ViX provides a decent amount of content, which can be viewed on smart TVs, as well as through a browser and iOS or Android devices. If you want to get rid of the adverts and view the full range of over 100 channels, along with thousands of movies and novellas, the premium subscription is excellent value at $6.99 a month or $49.99 a year.</p><p> Sports fans, and especially soccer enthusiasts, are also well catered for. You can access coverage from Liga MX, the EUFA Champions League, and beIN Sports, as well as more hardcore sporting pursuits like MMA from Combate Global and professional bull riding.</p><p> Provision for non-Spanish speakers is pretty limited, however. As ViX evolves, it may expand its subtitling efforts for English and other languages, but for now, it focuses on providing content that caters to its primary audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/vix-tv.png"                      alt="ViX streaming tv service"                > </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Streaming Service for Spanish-Language Television</p><h5 id="Vix-1"><a href="#Vix-1" class="headerlink" title="Vix"></a>Vix</h5><p>ViX offers a huge amount of Spanish-language content, including originals and co-productions with Amazon, making it one of the best places to find your favorite novellas or Latin American movies and sports. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vix.com/es-es/ondemand" >See at Vix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><h2 id="Best-Streaming-Service-for-Indie-and-Arthouse-Cinema-MUBI"><a href="#Best-Streaming-Service-for-Indie-and-Arthouse-Cinema-MUBI" class="headerlink" title="Best Streaming Service for Indie and Arthouse Cinema: MUBI"></a>Best Streaming Service for Indie and Arthouse Cinema: <a class="link"   href="https://mubi.com/" >MUBI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://mubi.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://mubi.com/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mubi.png"                      alt="MUBI banner"                > MUBI</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://mubi.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Diverse selection of challenging, fascinating films from various regions and eras</td><td>✗ Limited selection with titles frequently coming and going</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Expertly curated to provide targeted programming for cinephiles</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> If you miss the days of indie video stores or arthouse movie theaters, staffed by cinephiles with deep knowledge of obscure films, then <a class="link"   href="https://mubi.com/" >MUBI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the service for you. While other streaming services, even specialty-focused ones, tout their wide selection, MUBI is built on curation, debuting one new title each day, which is then available only for a limited time.</p><p> Instead of scrolling through seemingly endless lists of titles you’ve never heard of, you can open up MUBI and watch that day’s selection, confident that it’s been carefully selected by curators with impeccable taste and extensive knowledge.</p><p> That movie might be a masterwork by a pioneer of the French New Wave, a forgotten low-budget exploitation movie, or a new release from a titan of world cinema. Whatever it is, you can be assured that it will be challenging and rewarding to watch and enhance your appreciation of film as an art form.</p><p> MUBI also functions as an arthouse distributor. Its theatrical releases, including titles picked up from film festivals and restorations of neglected classics, end up streaming on MUBI following their theatrical runs.</p><p> MUBI’s business model means that if something you want to watch premieres on the service, you probably won’t be able to put it in a queue and get to it weeks or months later. Even if you miss out on a particularly enticing movie, there will be something else just as great premiering the next day.</p><p> At $12.99&#x2F;month (or $107.88&#x2F;year), Mubi is one of the more expensive options on the list. That said, you’re paying for expert curation and the ability to bypass the seemingly infinite “what should we watch?” loop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mubi.jpg"                      alt="mubi"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027195/19272" target="_top" id="2027195">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027195" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027195/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><p>Best Streaming Service for Indie&#x2F;Arthouse Cinema</p><h5 id="MUBI-1"><a href="#MUBI-1" class="headerlink" title="MUBI"></a>MUBI</h5><p>With its unique approach of premiering one movie a day, MUBI is perfect for adventurous cinephiles looking for expert guidance on what to watch.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://mubi.com/" >MUBI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Streaming-Service-for-Martial-Arts-Movies-Hi-Yah"><a href="#Best-Streaming-Service-for-Martial-Arts-Movies-Hi-Yah" class="headerlink" title="Best Streaming Service for Martial Arts Movies: Hi-Yah!"></a>Best Streaming Service for Martial Arts Movies: <a class="link"   href="https://www.hiyahtv.com/" >Hi-Yah! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.hiyahtv.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://www.hiyahtv.com/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hi-yah.png"                      alt="Hi-Yah banner"                > Hi-Yah!</a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.hiyahtv.com/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>✓ Selection of rare and in-demand movies</td><td>✗ Genre limitations</td></tr><tr><td>✓ Low price point</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> This streaming service’s silly but memorable name tells you exactly what <a class="link"   href="https://www.hiyahtv.com/" >Hi-Yah! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is about—martial arts action. Browse through Hi-Yah!’s selections, and you may be amazed at the depth and breadth of martial arts movies and related Asian action cinema. But followers of the genre have known for decades how rich and varied it can be, and they’re some of the most dedicated fans in all cinema.</p><p> Just tracking down many of these special foreign action movies has been a challenge for a long time, via a combination of import home video releases and questionable bootleg trades. But Hi-Yah! brings many previously unavailable martial arts movies together to stream, along with new premieres.</p><p> Martial arts stars like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, and Donnie Yen are all well-represented, but Hi-Yah! also goes beyond those famous names. The service seeks out up-and-coming talents and regional cinemas, so subscribers to Hi-Yah! may be the first to experience a new martial arts sensation from Malaysia or Indonesia. Genre fans who’ve worn out their classic Hong Kong action movie DVDs will still find plenty of new movies to explore here.</p><p> There’s no shortage of martial arts movies to fill out Hi-Yah!’s programming, and the service expands the definition to include other types of action movies from Asia. But unlike genres on other niche services, Hi-Yah!’s focus is so limited that even die-hard fans may get burned out on the same type of content.</p><p> The good thing is that Hi-Yah! is so inexpensive (just $4 a month) that it’s easy to pick up as an add-on to other services, even if you don’t use it constantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hi-yah.jpg"                      alt="hi-yah"                > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123748/7443" target="_top" id="2123748">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123748" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123748/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpresshttps://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png"                                     > </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144299/7443" target="_top" id="2144299">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144299" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144299/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Streaming Service for Martial Arts Movies</p><h5 id="Hi-Yah-1"><a href="#Hi-Yah-1" class="headerlink" title="Hi-Yah!"></a>Hi-Yah!</h5><p>All the action is on Hi-Yah!, featuring martial arts classics and other action movies from Asia, including exclusives and hard-to-find titles.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.hiyahtv.com/" >Hi-Yah! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pro-rated-cameras-for-windows-11-the-top-lineup-reviewed/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Pro-Rated Cameras for Windows 11 - The Top Lineup Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-from-windows-10-preparing-your-pc-for-the-upgrade/"><u>[New] From Windows 10 Preparing Your PC for the Upgrade</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-whats-the-best-cloud-storage-2024-know-these-5-for-your-needs/"><u>[New] What’s the Best Cloud Storage 2024?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The original Xbox One controller has undergone quite a few changes and iterations over the console’s long life. You’ve got the original version that launched with the Xbox One, a slightly updated version of that, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-s-controller-review-4770950" >One S controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and then the Elite. Each of these controllers were pretty well-received in their day, but Microsoft carefully improved and updated them throughout the years to make them even better.</p><p> We reviewed the original $150 Elite controller when it debuted years ago and loved nearly every aspect of it, but it wasn’t flawless suffering from the lack of a few key features and some durability issues. This is where the newly updated Elite Series 2 controller comes in. Listening to feedback provided by gamers on the weaknesses of Series 1, Microsoft has put out what is likely to be the last iteration of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-consoles-4156250" >Xbox One controller, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it’s pretty much perfect—provided you’re willing to pay the hefty price tag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/t8wI_yN2s_uIQ1leo87MmOnXxb4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-5-0c39ec4e89eb45b094471681efec0e7d.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed"><a href="#Design-Dark-sturdy-and-feature-packed" class="headerlink" title="Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed"></a><strong>Design: Dark, sturdy, and feature-packed</strong></h2><p> The general format of the Elite Series 2 takes the basic XB1 controller and builds upon that excellent design by adding in tons of extras and features. However, unlike the first Elite controller, this version uses the newer One S model controller as its basis. This means there is no more two-piece design where the top and bottom shells of the controller are separate. The build is less flashy perhaps, no longer sporting a two-tone finish, but it makes it feel much more solid and creates a sleeker look.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout. The original Elite used brushed aluminum as an accent tone, but that’s been swapped for a darker gunmetal finish that I personally love. This accent tone is found along the top bumpers and triggers (that are now textured plastic), as well as the analog sticks and Xbox&#x2F;home button. You’ll also notice that the mini<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at the top is now USB Type-C. Aside from my personal dream of this USB port becoming the universal design for all electronics, this implementation offers a superior port with better data transfer speeds and quicker charging times, so it’s nice to see here.</p><p> The grips this time have been heavily revamped (a welcome change as they were a point of weakness for durability on the Series 1), wrapping around the back, sides, and front for a seamless texture. Also changed from the previous Elite, these grips are no longer grey, but instead a nice black tone to match the rest of this black beauty.</p><p> For the face of the Series 2, the four iconic Xbox buttons are unchanged, but there are a few small changes elsewhere. The toggle switch from the Series 1 has now been swapped for a simple push-button that allows you to toggle between premade profiles with even more flexibility. It is easier to accidentally push, but we didn’t find it to be an issue.</p><p> One of the most striking changes to this area is the D-pad, which no longer sticks out from the design with its shiny aluminum surface. This time around, it’s sporting a flat black color that meshes much better with the overall look of the Series 2. It’s still got the radar-dish design that I personally find to be one of the best D-pad designs for any controller ever made.</p><p> The Series 2 is strikingly beautiful, with a subtle matte black finish forming the central body and some dark chrome accents throughout.</p><p> The rear of the Series 2 is slightly different from its predecessor, mainly the lack of a removable battery. Now this change is a bit polarizing for two main reasons. A rechargeable battery is super convenient since you can simply plug it in and juice it up, never having to worry about scrambling around for new batteries. On the other hand, this battery, like all rechargeable batteries, will ultimately wear down and eventually need replacing, which you can no longer do on your own. Much like smartphones that have ditched removable batteries, it seems like more and more devices are forgoing that option. We personally love the rechargeable pack included and supposedly it’ll last 10 years, but when it does get worn out, your only option is to send it in to have Microsoft replace it.</p><p> There is also a minimal charging strip where the battery sits, allowing you to use the included dock plugged into your USB-C cord to charge the controller when not in use. This dock is an excellent perk of the Series 2, negating the need for third-party docks that are often plagued with issues. I found it convenient to leave this dock plugged into the Xbox all the time so that I could place the controller there for a quick charge between gaming sessions or at the end of the night.</p><p> Battery aside, the rear of the Series 2 also features the optional paddles and extra buttons if you like to use those for added customization. The only difference with these is the finish, which now matches the dark tone of the D-pad. Lastly, the hair triggers return, but now have three different settings instead of two, providing even more potential customizing.</p><p> The final part of the design we’d like to discuss is the case. The first Elite also included a case, but this too has been refreshed for the Series 2. The first thing of note is that it isn’t quite the same case just rehashed. Close inspection shows that the material has also been changed a bit, making it smoother and less scratchy. The zipper also uses the new gunmetal finish. One of the more important changes to the case is that the top now includes a port for the charging dock, so you can even charge your controller right inside the case.</p><p> Inside the case, the material has also been swapped from grey to black to continue the darker theme of the Series 2. You’ll also notice the foam pad is no longer here, as that’s where the dock sits. This dock can be removed or used inside the case and attaches with a strong magnet. The last two parts of the case are unchanged from Series 1, with a mesh cradle for accessories on the top and a foam organizer to hold all the swappable thumbsticks and paddles when not in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TRrezKVbAUPs2Rud3g4_iOHyxB8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-2-4b3f9d8acd1440089989378253d902f4.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy"><a href="#Comfort-Hefty-but-darn-comfy" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy"></a><strong>Comfort: Hefty, but darn comfy</strong></h2><p> The original Elite was perhaps the most comfortable controller I’ve ever used, so with the Series 2, I had high hopes in this department. Thanks to some clever but subtle changes by the Microsoft team, this controller is even better.</p><p> The main points of ergonomic superiority the Elite has over the cheaper XB1 controllers stem from the finish, grips and sheer customization that allows each user to tailor their controller to their preference. With so many options between different combinations of thumbsticks, D-pads, and paddles, everyone can find their optimal setup after some experimenting.</p><p> The grips are perhaps the most important part of this realm since that’s where your hands will be in contact with the controller most of the time. Luckily, they’re even better on the Series 2. While the original Elite only had rubberized grips along the back, the Series 2 has them wrapped around the full circumference of the device. This means your hands rest on them completely, providing a nice grippy surface that never gets slippery.</p><p> The last point of comfort I appreciated on the Series 2 is the textured triggers. While somewhat gimmicky, I found it to be better suited for quickly identifying between the triggers and bumpers, similar to how the home row on your keyboard has bumps on it.</p><p> The only real issue some users may see as a downside of this controller is that it’s quite a hefty device. The controller weighs 348 grams with all attachments, so it might take some getting used to compared to the 210 gram S controller. I personally love the bulk, as it feels premium, but it might not be for everyone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cS5fpyPSlqvyETs-nGxTtAB3vXU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-4-070b6c59b206457ba1068704bbe7bca9.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139113/17108" target="_top" id="2139113">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139113" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139113/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Software-Bluetooth-at-long-last" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last"></a><strong>Setup Process and Software: Bluetooth, at long last</strong></h2><p> One of our biggest gripes with the original Elite controller was that it lacked Bluetooth functionality despite its premium price tag. Seeing how the much cheaper ONE S variant included this, it was even more frustrating. Thankfully, Microsoft listened to our collective rants and added Bluetooth to the Series 2, which drastically improves the number of devices it can be used with.</p><p> The overall setup process for the new Series 2 is quick and simple (more so than the first Elite). So let’s cover how to use it with both your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-buyers-guide-3562291" >Xbox One <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and PC. First things first, make sure the rechargeable battery is sufficiently charged (it comes charged out of the box) and you’re ready to pair it with the console.</p><p> To do so, turn on your console first and wait for it to fully boot. Now power on the controller and hold down the pairing button on the top until the Xbox symbol flashes. Then do the same thing on your console’s pairing button until both begin to rapidly flash (this indicates they are searching for each other). Once paired, the flashing will slow and then stop completely to show they have successfully paired.</p><p> As we stated earlier, the inclusion of Bluetooth means using the Series 2 with your PC is even easier than previous<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/games-console-reviews-4102640" >Xbox One controllers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For those who plan to use their Elite Series 2 with a PC, this is perhaps the single best upgrade over the Series 1, because you no longer need the annoyingly large adapter to pair it with your PC (also saving you an additional $25).</p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC.</p><p> To do this, first ensure your PC is running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and your controller is also updated. Next, you can turn on the controller and head to the computer. At your desktop, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices, then turn Bluetooth on so it can discover the controller. After doing so, you should see “Xbox Wireless Controller” pop up, and you can now click “pair” from there and you’re ready to game.</p><p> For those who want to use their PC for local multiplayer games, it should also be noted that you can only connect one Bluetooth controller to your PC at a time. In addition to that limitation, you also can’t use any attachments like headsets, chat pads or the stereo adapter in this mode.</p><p> If you plan to buy this controller to use with other electronics that support Bluetooth devices, make sure you do some research before committing to it, as it doesn’t always work with everything. That said, we did manage to pair the controller with a couple other devices that weren’t officially supported.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v25KBj3XhkgWMjFaqVnLVUUJqSY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-3-29dc70adabc64f888db60e817695153f.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability"><a href="#Performance-Durability-Enhanced-performance-and-durability" class="headerlink" title="Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability"></a><strong>Performance&#x2F;Durability: Enhanced performance and durability</strong></h2><p> To test the performance of the new Elite Series 2 controller, I put this device through several hours of gaming on both PC and Xbox One platforms running a number of games and layouts. The results were promising, so let’s take a closer look.</p><p> Enhanced performance in games is one of the big selling points of the Elite, which is marketed towards players who want to gain an advantage over those with regular controllers. While subtle, I did feel that the Elite improved some small aspects of my gameplay, though skill trumps this in every way.</p><p> For things like shooters, the hair triggers will give you a slight increase to reaction time, as there is less pull, but it takes some getting used to. The longer thumbsticks supposedly help with things like aim time, but getting used to them requires a bit of relearning to get the muscle memory rewired. Personally, I prefer the shorter sticks, but to each their own.</p><p> The paddles are great for adding additional functionality to your controller that non-Elite controllers can’t touch. For racing games like Forza, using these to shift gears means you can do so without having to move your fingers from other buttons. However, because these are unique to the Elite controllers, new users will have a steep learning curve to successfully implement them into their gameplay.</p><p> This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console.</p><p> The enhanced D-pad is perhaps my favorite piece of kit to instantly improve gaming performance. For things like platformers or fighting games, the dish design is exceptionally good at helping you to nail combos or tricky movements, and I always have it equipped.</p><p> No matter what games we used the Series 2 with, from Destiny 2 to Dragon Ball Fighter Z and more, we felt the controller added a subtle but noticeable boost to performance over a regular controller. That being said, it won’t drastically make you better, so don’t get your hopes up.</p><p> In terms of durability, this new Series 2 addresses several weaknesses of the Series 1. The rubber grips used to be a particularly weak point, coming unglued from the body over time. It seems like Microsoft have fixed this, but only time will tell.</p><p> The bumpers on every XB1 controller up until the One S were another point of failure due to the thin plastic piece that attached them to the controller. If you dropped your controller in just the right spot, even from a short height, they often broke and flopped around, requiring you to either send it in for repair or fix it yourself at home. The original Elite also suffered from this, and I experienced this with my first device. Now that the Series 2 is built off the S controller, this is supposedly no longer an issue.</p><p> While we didn’t experience any durability issues with our controller, the long-term durability will need to be assessed at a later date, though it seems to have gotten some upgrades to resolve issues of the past.</p><h2 id="Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console"><a href="#Price-Like-buying-a-brand-new-console" class="headerlink" title="Price: Like buying a brand new console"></a><strong>Price: Like buying a brand new console</strong></h2><p> Right now, the Elite Series 2 controller retails at an MSRP of $249.99, about $100 more than its predecessor. This price tag makes it not only the most expensive first-party controller around, but also nearly the cost of a brand new Xbox One S console (or three brand new titles). That can be a tough sell for your average gamer.</p><p> Sure, all of the included extras, customization potential, and the ultra-premium feel is nice, but does that warrant the cost? Well, that’s for you to decide ultimately, but if you do plan on fully utilizing the customization potential, it’s probably worth it. Otherwise, the One S is probably sufficient.</p><p> The argument could be made that considering you get a Bluetooth controller capable of working on XB1 and PC, a charging dock and a nice little case to keep it all together, the cost isn’t awful. But if you want all of those things for less, you can grab an S controller, dock and case for far, far less.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6VfCJGOyjLkAkE_mjiHr7rz8Gyw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-6-0c1d7a2ae4e8443ea5b69f559e52bd12.jpg"                      alt="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller"><a href="#Xbox-One-Elite-Series-2-Controller-vs-Xbox-One-Elite-Series-1-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller"></a><strong>Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller vs. Xbox One Elite Series 1 Controller</strong></h2><p> Since the Elite controller really is in a league of its own, the biggest competitor to it is the first generation, which can still be purchased from a number of retailers. We’re going to quickly compare the two to see which might be best for you.</p><p> So we’ve covered a lot of the differences between the two series throughout this article, and while the second iteration is much improved over the first, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/xbox-one-elite-controller-review-4770957" >original Elite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is still a perfectly capable controller with most of the same features. Now that the new one is out, the older model has also dropped a bit in price—making it more appealing. The price of the Series 1 can vary wildly from as little as $100 all the way up to the original tag of $150 depending on where you look, but saving up to $80 for a controller with mostly the same features is an excellent way to get into the Elite series for less.</p><p> Cost aside, there are a few key things you’ll lose if you go with the first model. Perhaps the most noteworthy advantage the Series 2 has is Bluetooth connectivity. This key feature means you no longer need the obtrusive USB wireless adapter to use it with a PC, and it’ll also work with more devices. The other major advantage is the durability improvements on the second iteration, which should make it last even longer.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A truly awesome controller with a steep price point.</strong></p><p> Everything we disliked about the original Elite controller has been improved with the second iteration, making it the best first-party controller you can get for XB1 or PC. However, the steep price point might be a hard pill to swallow for users who don’t like to splurge.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Xbox One Elite Series 2 Controller</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>MPN  400063527030</li><li>Price  $249.99</li><li>Weight  2.89 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.6 x 3.6 x 7.6 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Type  Elite</li><li>Wired&#x2F;Wireless  Wireless</li><li>Removable Cable  Yes</li><li>Battery life  ~40 hours</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;outputs  USB Type-C, 3.5mm jack, Xbox data port</li><li>Warranty  90-day warranty</li><li>Compatibility  All Xbox One Consoles, Windows 10 PCs, Bluetooth devices</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-beyondbasics-futurecameraspost-mycam/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved BeyondBasics FutureCamerasPost-MyCam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/download-software-u-are-u-fingerreader-v450x/"><u>Download Software: U-Are-U FingerReader V4.50x</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/elite-ai-visual-editing-software-for-2024/"><u>Elite AI Visual Editing Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-realme-12-pro-5g-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Realme 12 Pro 5G by Phone Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ram-revamp-enhancing-your-computer/"><u>RAM Revamp: Enhancing Your Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/returns-the-angle-in-degrees-by-converting-it-from-radians-to-degrees-with-radiantodegree-function/"><u>Returns the Angle in Degrees by Converting It From Radians to Degrees with `Radian_to_degree` Function.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/roku-transforms-your-viewing-space-with-advanced-soundscape/"><u>Roku Transforms Your Viewing Space with Advanced Soundscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/sx720hs-powershot-camera-portable-long-range-shooting-magic/"><u>SX720HS PowerShot Camera: Portable, Long-Range Shooting Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/taking-audio-to-new-heights-with-samsung-buds-pro/"><u>Taking Audio to New Heights with Samsung Buds Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-tips-restore-your-windows-11-start-menu/"><u>Troubleshooting Tips: Restore Your Windows 11 Start Menu</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/unlocking-fullscreen-footage-screen-recording-made-simple-for-mac-users-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Fullscreen Footage Screen Recording Made Simple for Mac Users for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Once installed, the Linksys app quickly detected the first Velop node after I’d plugged in its ethernet cable and power adapter. However, I had significant difficulty getting the Velop to connect to my modem. The app initially failed to pick up an internet signal and had me fully power off my modem for a full two minutes. I went through this process several times without success. I tried reaching out to Linksys technical support to get it up and running, but their advice got me nowhere.</p><p> After two days of frustration I reset the router one last time and it just worked, as if it knew I was about to give up on it and had decided it had inflicted enough torture upon me.</p><p> Finally, after two days of frustration, I reset the router one last time and it just worked, as if it knew I was about to give up on it and had decided it had inflicted enough torture upon me. I was able to create an account and set up the network easily after this, though getting each node connected required a lot of patience. In addition to the lengthy wait required to connect each note, the entire system initiated a major update that added yet more time to the installation process.</p><p> It should also be noted that the color-coding of the indicator light with blue, purple, and red increased the difficulty for me, as my colorblindness made distinguishing the different signals challenging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vd7GD3E75V8bNVCQCRo-Mu9_xRw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Linksys-Velop-Mesh-Router-2-2ebd64bd82ea492bb2058a194b00e369.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Long-range-consistency"><a href="#Connectivity-Long-range-consistency" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Long-range consistency"></a><strong>Connectivity: Long-range consistency</strong></h2><p> While using the Linksys Velop, my Wi-Fi signal never dropped in strength within my 4,000 square foot home, and the Linksys Velop could easily provide an acceptable network throughout a much larger building. I was able to easily connect to the internet from anywhere within my yard, and if somehow the three Velop units aren’t enough you can always buy a fourth to expand your network.</p><p> The triband hybrid mesh network produced by the Velop did a good job of eliminating dead zones within my house.</p><p> Since I have a slow DSL connection speed, I was unable to test the upper limits of the Velop’s speed capabilities. However, in my tests, I did find that it was able to take full advantage of my connection and in fact, outdid connecting an ethernet connection directly to my router. Speeds were consistent throughout my home, though they started to drop off once I went outdoors and put considerable obstacles between me and the router nodes.</p><p> The triband hybrid mesh network, which uses a dynamic combination of 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz networks, produced by the Velop did a good job of eliminating dead zones within my house.

It tells you the status of your connection, which devices are connected, and allows you to check how fast your internet connection currently is. You can also manage prioritization of up to three different devices, set up a guest network, set parental controls, and adjust advanced network settings. It’s also compatible with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> However, some features are annoyingly gated behind a paywall, and the app actively advertises these subscription services to you. The first of these extra features that you have to pay for concerns about parental control. While you can pause internet access for a certain device, schedule internet access pauses, and block specific websites, you have to pay $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year if you want to block websites by category.</p><p> There’s also Linksys Aware, which senses motion in your home using your Wi-Fi network and alerts you if an intruder is detected. However, that will cost you $2.99 per month or $24.99 per year. It may not sound like much for either of these services, but those costs add up over the course of a few years, and it’s easy to forget that you’re paying such auto-renewing subscriptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OW4WI4lGaO1oov8mmseffBvbCUY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Linksys-Velop-Mesh-Router-3-515007e4fdad41bda5124c53ab7a1e6d.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Price-A-bit-steep"><a href="#Price-A-bit-steep" class="headerlink" title="Price: A bit steep"></a><strong>Price: A bit steep</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $400, the Linksys Velop is quite a pricey Wi-Fi system to invest in. Also, if you want some of the exciting added features, you’ll be paying extra for those optional services.

The Deco 9 was quick and easy to set up, whereas the Velop was a pain to get up and running. The Deco P9 is also almost half the price of the Velop and provides a similar degree of performance. However, I found that Deco P9 was prone to overheating and occasional signal loss, while the Velop stayed reassuringly cool and provided an absolute rock-solid signal.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The Linksys Velop is an expensive, but powerful and reliable mesh Wi-Fi system with a few irritating issues.</strong></p><p> At its core, the Linksys Velop is a particularly powerful and high-quality mesh Wi-Fi system. However, I can’t ignore the difficulty I experienced setting it up, and the high cost with some features locked behind subscription fees makes this router hard to recommend over the competition.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Velop AC6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi System</li><li>Product Brand  Linksys</li><li>SKU  WHW0303</li><li>Price  $400.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.1 x 3.1 x 7.3 in.</li><li>Parental control  Yes</li><li>Guest Netowrk  Yes</li><li>Range  6,000 sq ft</li><li>Warranty  3 years</li><li>Ports  2 ethernet ports per node</li><li>Network  Tri band</li><li>Software  Linksys App</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-hidden-truths-about-youtube-earnings/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Hidden Truths About YouTube Earnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-navigating-video-sharing-from-imovie-to-the-vimeo-network/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Navigating Video Sharing From iMovie to the Vimeo Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/2024s-leading-nas-units-reviewed-choose-the-perfect-data-management-solution/"><u>2024'S Leading NAS Units Reviewed - Choose the Perfect Data Management Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/football-manager-2021-what-to-do-when-youre-stuck-on-the-start-screen/"><u>Football Manager 2021: What To Do When You're Stuck on the Start Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-the-lock-screen-on-my-itel-p55-5g-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>How to Unlock the Lock Screen on my Itel P55 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/in-2024-cutting-edge-vector-images-top-10-websites/"><u>In 2024, Cutting-Edge Vector Images Top 10 Websites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-itel-s23plus-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock a Network Locked Itel S23+ Phone?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-15-pro-without-passcode-or-face-id-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 15 Pro without Passcode or Face ID</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/step-by-step-tutorial-rapid-intel-nuc-driver-setup/"><u>Step-by-Step Tutorial: Rapid Intel NUC Driver Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-selection-elite-pick-for-ipad-pro-11-case-protection/"><u>Ultimate Selection: Elite Pick for iPad Pro 11 Case Protection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-selection-the-leading-7g-wi-fi-routers-for-optimal-performance/"><u>Ultimate Selection: The Leading 7G Wi-Fi Routers for Optimal Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-showdown-the-leading-flat-screen-tv-models-of-2023-unveiled/"><u>Ultimate Showdown: The Leading Flat Screen TV Models of 2023 Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-tech-presents-top-picks-for-hardcore-enthusiasts-holiday-haul/"><u>Ultimate Tech Presents: Top Picks for Hardcore Enthusiasts' Holiday Haul</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-pan-and-zoom-how-to-achieve-the-ken-burns-effect-for-2024/"><u>Updated The Art of Pan and Zoom How to Achieve the Ken Burns Effect for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/utilize-reputable-gaming-performance-benchmarks-like-cinebench-passmark-and-3dmark-to-compare-different-hardware-configurations-within-your-budget-range/"><u>Utilize Reputable Gaming Performance Benchmarks Like Cinebench, PassMark, and 3DMark to Compare Different Hardware Configurations Within Your Budget Range.</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The best jump starters blend portability with reliability. Most importantly, it needs to resurrect your car, every time, as quickly as possible (and with minimal hassle). On the other hand, for all the times you’re not in an emergency situation, it needs to tuck neatly away in your car, and not hog a ton of valuable real estate. To find out just how well the DBPOWER 600A Peak 18000mAh Portable Car Jump Starter struck this balance we purposefully drained a car’s battery and got to work testing.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case"><a href="#Design-A-rugged-brick-of-power-contained-within-its-own-nice-case" class="headerlink" title="Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case"></a><strong>Design: A rugged brick of power contained within its own nice case</strong></h2><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case with a relatively durable zipper holding the two sides of the case together. One side contains the unit itself within a foam insert, and the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. The idea here is that you can keep the case stashed in your trunk or under a seat and have everything you need.</p><p> The unit itself is a surprisingly small red and black brick, constructed out of plastic that feels both rugged and yet somehow also soft to the touch. There’s a flashlight on one end of the unit that is mounted flush within the case and on one corner of the case there’s a compass; presumably for the times where you get really lost. All the device’s inputs, outputs, the display, and the on&#x2F;off switch are found on one of the longer sides. No cables stick out from the unit itself, as you must use one of the accessories to enable the device to do any of its actual work.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> The accessory kit contains a wall charger and a 12V port charger for the unit, a DC cable, and a variety of ends to allow for charging a laptop. The jumper cables sprout from a module that plugs into a specific port on the unit and terminate in your standard clamps. The module itself has a status light that illuminates to indicate the unit’s readiness to jump start the car.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use"><a href="#Setup-Process-The-cables-are-short-but-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use"></a><strong>Setup Process: The cables are short but easy to use</strong></h2><p> It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car. You plug the jumper cable module into the unit, which will cause its module light to flash green, then connect the red clamp to the positive terminal on your car’s battery and the black clamp to the negative terminal which will cause the module light to illuminate solid green. With our test vehicle it was a little difficult to get the clamps on the negative terminal as they are a little large, and the cables themselves are on the short side. With the clamps in position all that is left is to start the car and remove the clamps in reverse order.</p><p>It’s a breeze using the 600A to jump start a car.</p><p> If it’s other devices that need power, you simply need to turn the unit on and then plug them into the appropriate port. For a laptop, that means you must pick the correct adapter, use the power button to switch the unit to the right power mode for your laptop, and plug it into the DC power port. For a phone or other USB device you pretty much just need to pick one of the two ports and plug in, though the smart port provides better amperage and faster charging.</p><h2 id="Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road"><a href="#Performance-Immediate-power-to-get-you-back-on-the-road" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road"></a><strong>Performance: Immediate power to get you back on the road</strong></h2><p> When it comes to its ability to provide power, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter doesn’t disappoint. It reliably started a 2011 Hyundai Elantra that had a battery depleted down to 10V with zero issues, multiple times. With as small as it is, we did have some (thankfully unfounded) concerns that the unit might slide down into the engine bay as soon as the engine started.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> Charging USB devices is not only simple but fast as well, with a sustained 1,200 mAh current. This level of charging will top off your devices in a hurry, and with 18,000 mAh capacity the unit should be able to charge a phone like the Samsung Galaxy S10 five times over. Be aware that if your phone uses a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection you’ll need to provide your own cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass"><a href="#Key-Features-A-decent-flashlight-and-oddly-a-compass" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass"></a><strong>Key Features: A decent flashlight and, oddly, a compass</strong></h2><p> Small as it’s, the DBPOWER Portable Jump Starter has a few extra features of note. The flashlight built into the case is decent, but doesn’t put out much light and does so within a relatively narrow angle. However, with as small as the unit is, you can easily just hold the whole thing in your hand like a flashlight to illuminate whatever you need.</p><p>It packs a ton of value into its diminutive size.</p><p> As mentioned before the case does have a compass on it, which is a curious addition to a tool such as this. It’s quite small and is neither illuminated nor does it glow in the dark. We suppose it might be useful to get your bearings in an unfamiliar area, but chances are decent you’re just going to get the car jump started and get back on the road instead.</p><p> Speaking of which, one method of charging the device is through<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >your car’s 12V power port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This means that you can pop the hood on a car with a dead battery, get it jump started, and then use the running car to charge the jump starter as you drive to your next destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter"><a href="#Price-A-low-cost-for-such-a-feature-packed-jump-starter" class="headerlink" title="Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter"></a><strong>Price: A low cost for such a feature-packed jump starter</strong></h2><p> You can find this model available online for between $70 and $75, and at that price point it packs a ton of value into its diminutive size. There are other units that are a little less expensive, but generally at the expense of some features or included accessories.</p><h2 id="Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you"><a href="#Competition-Splitting-hairs-on-what-features-matter-most-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you"></a><strong>Competition: Splitting hairs on what features matter most to you</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Beatit BT-D11:</em></strong> The two units are so similar in their design and production that it really boils down to one question: How important is charging your laptop to you? If it’s worth the extra $10, stick with the DBPOWER 600A. If not, you can pick up the Beatit BT-D11 for a bit less money and otherwise get a strikingly similar unit.</p><p><strong><em>Aickar Car Jump Starter:</em></strong> Between these two it’s almost too close to call. While the Aickar costs a mere few dollars less, it also has better output current for more reliable jump starts.

It comes from a long series of Rayman games but brings an upgrade in graphics and gameplay, creating a game that not only longtime fans will be happy with, but first-time players, too. We played this game on the PS4 to further explore the game’s plot, gameplay, graphics, and sound design―and we were not disappointed.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy as it should be"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy as it should be</strong></h2><p> Setup for Rayman Legends is what you would expect.

Be aware, though, that certain features of the game will not be accessible if your PS4 is not connected to the internet. Specifically, you won’t be able to access the Challenges mode, where you can play weekly challenges against other Rayman Legends players.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1013424/11832" target="_top" id="1013424">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1013424" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1013424/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-Not-much-of-one-but-who-cares"><a href="#Plot-Not-much-of-one-but-who-cares" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Not much of one, but who cares?"></a><strong>Plot: Not much of one, but who cares?</strong></h2><p> The Rayman games have been around for years, dating back to the original, which was published in 1995. Since then, the story, characters, art, and gameplay have come a long way. In this game, you’ll choose a level―each of which is uniquely themed and has multiple maps for you to work your way through.</p><p> Rayman Legends isn’t focused on plot; it’s more interested in providing outstanding gameplay.</p><p> Once you’ve loaded into a map, you’ll come face to face with the hero’s enemy, the Magician. He’s determined to capture all the royal Teensies in the game (a small blue creature you must find and set free in each map).</p><p> You’ll chase after him, jumping from platform to platform, slaying the occasional enemy as you go. That’s about it when it comes to the plot of Rayman Legends. Sometimes the Magician will give you a specific enemy to dodge, like a giant red dragon, and at the end of certain maps, you’ll get an opportunity to catch him. But really, Rayman Legends isn’t focused on plot; it’s more interested in providing outstanding gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-Un250xgOCxgaGgFeykC6pihaaU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118212347-5c8ffe8d46e0fb0001f8d0cc.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><h2 id="Gameplay-What-this-is-really-about"><a href="#Gameplay-What-this-is-really-about" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: What this is really about"></a><strong>Gameplay: What this is really about</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-platform-game-812371" >2D platformer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , reminiscent of such games as Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, but with its own history and development. Be prepared to do lots of jumping, the occasional timed run, and even a few boss fights. Thankfully, Rayman Legend is fairly forgiving when it comes to platformers. The controls are smooth, jumps are generally easy to land, and a glide feature can save you when you accidentally jump too late. Plus, a nice distribution of save points make it easy to try again if you do die.</p><p> While each level does get progressively harder as you go (indicated by the number of small skulls under the map entrance), most are achievable by the average player. There’s also the added bonus that if you are having trouble, you can force your friend to join you. When one of you dies, you’ll just turn into a bubble and your friend can free you with an attack.</p><p> This game is fairly forgiving: The controls are smooth, jumps are generally easy to land, and a glide feature can save you when you accidentally jump too late.</p><p> Teaming up for the harder levels not only makes the game a little easier, but it also makes the game more fun. You can co-op with up to four people at a time on the PS4, which combined with the casual and fun nature of the game makes it a great recommendation for best friends or for a couple who enjoys gaming together.</p><p> In the game, there are six levels, each with roughly ten maps. You’ll have to work your way through the first level to unlock the second, and so forth. Unlocks are achieved when you reach a certain number of Teensies saved―which the Magician has locked up and hidden in various places throughout each map. There is also a type of in-game currency called “Lums” that you collect as you run through each map (they look like pink or gold fireflies).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oJz1vIp26cdVH1115RCHTapRpTE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118215643-5c8ffe7346e0fb000146adbb.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> When you’ve reached a certain number of Lums, you’ll be able to unlock new heroes, which there is no shortage of. The levels grow gradually more complex as you progress, and while we admit that most levels weren’t too difficult, a few at the end of the game will be challenging for even well-practiced players.</p><p> Beyond the basic six levels and maps, the game’s other features are also great. There is a Soccer mode, where you play on a small 2D field versus your friend; scratchers that are rewarded after certain levels, where you use the PS4’s touchpad to reveal a random reward; and a creatures page where you can view all the weird Rayman creatures you’ve collected from scratchers.</p><p> Our favorite feature is the ability to unlock levels from Rayman Origins, the game that came before Rayman Legends. It’s like you’re getting two games for the price of one.</p><p> The Challenges mode, which we mentioned earlier, is where you can attempt weekly challenges, earn rewards, and get your username on the leaderboards. The last feature―our favorite―is the ability to unlock levels from Rayman Origins, the game that came before Rayman Legends. It’s like you’re getting two games for the price of one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Cartoony-but-appropriate"><a href="#Graphics-Cartoony-but-appropriate" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Cartoony but appropriate"></a><strong>Graphics: Cartoony but appropriate</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends has a unique look, which is represented fairly well by its bright and eye-catching cover. It doesn’t attempt to be realistic but embraces cartoon-like graphics, with goofy characters and villains mildly reminiscent of real-life creatures. In the level titled Toad Story, you’ll come across screaming toad monsters carrying swords and shields.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ccE0U5KQNuFzIwrnVe2EtwkrG_g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118211106-5c90015f46e0fb000146adbe.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> In the Fiesta De Los Muertos level, be prepared to smash brightly colored mariachi skeletons. No matter which level, though, the art style is consistent, and while not traditionally beautiful, it’s enjoyable and fun―a perfect fit for the game.</p><h2 id="Audio-A-hidden-treasure"><a href="#Audio-A-hidden-treasure" class="headerlink" title="Audio: A hidden treasure"></a><strong>Audio: A hidden treasure</strong></h2><p> Generally speaking, the sound and music in Rayman Legends is well designed and fits with the feel of the rest of the game. But there is one thing worth mentioning when it comes to the sound and music of the game―and in our opinion, it’s the coolest thing about Rayman Legends.</p><p> At the end of each level, a special map is unlocked. This map is themed to fit with the level’s design, and each features a specific song. You’ll load in, be told to prepare yourself to run at full speed while jumping and smashing enemies, and then, as you set off, the first notes of the song begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JIMvxIzHzgo1AXBmpTp3LxpzmTQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118210656-5c9001cd46e0fb000172f0b1.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> The beauty of these maps is how well the gameplay is designed to match the beats of the song, from how each jump will strike with the strum of a guitar, or how the smash of a drum will be timed with the slaying of an enemy. The levels might take you a few tries to finish, as they’re timed and require precision, but they’re fun enough you won’t mind doing them again.</p><h2 id="Price-Very-reasonable-for-the-content"><a href="#Price-Very-reasonable-for-the-content" class="headerlink" title="Price: Very reasonable for the content"></a><strong>Price: Very reasonable for the content</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends can be purchased for most systems at around $20. Sometimes PlayStation will put the item on sale, and you might even be able to get a copy for less than $15.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch version of the game is more expensive, so beware. However, no matter which system you’d prefer to play on, the value is worth it. The game has a lot of extra content and is more than fun enough to warrant the cost.</p><p> Deal alert</p><p> Sometimes PlayStation will put the item on sale, and you might even be able to get a copy for less than $15.</p><h2 id="Competition-More-co-op-platformers"><a href="#Competition-More-co-op-platformers" class="headerlink" title="Competition: More co-op platformers"></a><strong>Competition: More co-op platformers</strong></h2><p> If you enjoy the Rayman characters and style, there are a lot more Rayman games to explore. We probably wouldn’t suggest getting Rayman Origins since much of that gameplay is included in Rayman Legends, but one could look at Rayman Adventures. If you’re looking for other fun co-op platformers, we would suggest any of the Trine games, which focus on character-swapping and puzzles more than Rayman Legends, or Nintendo’s New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe for the classic Mario experience.</p><p> Read more reviews of the best PlayStation 4 kids games available to purchase online.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Get this game. It’s fun, creative, and different.</strong></p><p> Between the co-op option, the extra levels, the ability to replay Rayman Origins, and all the other things you can unlock from special heroes to scratchers, this game has a lot to offer for gamers of all ages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144299/7443" target="_top" id="2144299">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144299" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144299/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Worlds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/minecraft-review-4777049" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ratchet-and-clank-review-4777051" >Ratchet &amp;

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123732/7443" target="_top" id="2123732">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123732" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123732/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner.

Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements.

The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> As important a job as a jump starter does when it comes to a situation where your vehicle just won’t start, you need a solution that’s reliable yet easy to live with when you don’t need it. The Beatit BT-D11 800A Peak 18000mAh 12V Portable Car Jump Starter contains a lot of power within a small case, and along with its semi-hard case it shows promise to be a great companion to bring along in your vehicle. To see just how well it does the job of resurrecting a non-starting vehicle we drained the battery of a 2011 Hyundai Elantra down to 10V.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame"><a href="#Design-A-lot-of-power-packed-into-a-small-frame" class="headerlink" title="Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame"></a><strong>Design: A lot of power packed into a small frame</strong></h2><p> The Beatit Jump Starter D11’s main unit’s effectively a small black brick with red accents. Roughly the size of a small paperback book, the unit’s constructed out of durable plastic and features a flashlight at one end. Along one of the long sides there’s a small display that shows battery status, the on&#x2F;off switch, two USB power outputs, and the device’s charging port. On the opposing side a rubber flap covers the jumper cable port; a unique port that the jumper cable accessory plugs in to.</p><p> The unit and all its accessories are contained within a semi-hard case. The clamshell design has two halves that zip together to keep the case closed. One side of the case contains the unit itself within a foam insert, while the other is an elastic mesh pouch for all the accessories. There’s plenty of room to keep everything involved with the jump starter within its case, and with its shape and relatively small size we found it easy to keep the case in the car.</p><p> Time and again, the Beatit D11 was able to get a car with a very depleted battery started.</p><p> The list of accessories that come with the unit includes both a wall charger and a 12V port charger, a Micro USB cable to charge devices with, and the jumper cables themselves. The jumper cable accessory is a pair of terminal clamps with relatively short cables that together join into a plastic module that plugs into the specific port on the unit. The module has a single status LED on its side that flashes different colors to signify different conditions, such as the unit being ready for jump starting, or indicating incorrect connection of the clamps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938750/19272" target="_top" id="1938750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938750/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler"><a href="#Setup-Process-It-can’t-realistically-be-much-simpler" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler"></a><strong>Setup Process: It can’t realistically be much simpler</strong></h2><p> Should you find yourself in a situation where you need to use the jump start functionality of the Beatit Jump Starter D11, you’ll find it quite easy to use. On our Elantra test vehicle we simply had to pop the hood, bring the unit over, and plug the jumper cable accessory into its port. Once in place getting a proper connection is a simple matter of attaching the red clamp to the positive battery terminal and then the black clamp to the negative terminal. With a firm connection in place we simply had to set the unit down someplace where the vibration of the engine wouldn’t make it slide and then start the car. With the unit in place the car immediately started with zero hesitation, at which point we could disconnect the unit and get back on the road.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><p> If it’s your other devices that are having some battery issues, the D11’s two USB ports can be used to charge them up. The 2.1A port provides for faster charging, and while the 1A port also works it really doesn’t provide power in a hurry and should only be used with specific devices that can’t handle the other port’s amperage. For most modern phones you’re just going to want to plug it into the 2.1A port and enjoy the faster recharge.</p><h2 id="Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs"><a href="#Performance-Plenty-of-power-for-all-your-needs" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs"></a><strong>Performance: Plenty of power for all your needs</strong></h2><p> Time and again, the Beatit Jump Starter D11 was able to get a car with a very<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-batteries-are-made-to-die-534765" >depleted battery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> started. Even after repeated testing the unit’s own battery only dropped down to 85% capacity.</p><p> Charging a phone with a jump starter seems like overkill, and the unit’s ability to charge at 1,200mAh confirms that impression. At such an elevated level of charging your phone or other device will likely get its battery topped off in very little time. With 18,000mAh of capacity you can fully charge a modern phone at least twice, and still leave the unit with the juice it needs in order to start a car.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><h2 id="Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight"><a href="#Key-Features-The-flashlight-is-nice-but-is-basically-a-spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight"></a><strong>Key Features: The flashlight is nice but is basically a spotlight</strong></h2><p> There aren’t a ton of other features present with the Beatit Jump Starter D11 but there are some of note, including the unit’s built-in flashlight. It’s a nice addition to have if you must jump start a car in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t put out of a ton of light and the beam is pretty narrow. You can pick the unit up and use it as a large flashlight, though doing so while also trying to get the clamps attached is cumbersome.</p><p> A nice feature that is present in many jump starters but always appreciated is the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V port charger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you charge the unit back up within the car once you have it started. Charging from the wall charger is faster overall, but people with a dodgy battery but a working alternator will appreciate being able to use the jump starter to get their car started and then charge the unit back up as they drive to their destination.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Tony Mitera</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost"><a href="#Price-A-ton-of-value-for-a-tiny-cost" class="headerlink" title="Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost"></a><strong>Price: A ton of value for a tiny cost</strong></h2><p> The MSRP of the Beatit Jump Starter D11 is $70 which makes it one of the most affordable jump starters on the market.

The four external active antennas are chunky, evocative of their impressive power, and decked out with soothing blue LEDs.</p><p> A row of LED indicators marches across the angled front surface of the router, easily readable whether wall-mounted or left on your desk, providing visual confirmation of data transfer from the internet, over each wireless band and the guest network, each USB port, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-fast-is-ethernet-817549" >10G connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and each individual Ethernet connection.</p><p> Most of the connectors are located around back, along with a physical switch to turn off the LEDs on the antennas.

The router is basically ready to go right out of the box, which is a big time saver.</p><p> A lot of routers I test require a modem reboot, which is a bit of a pain as my network is set up with the modem and router in different rooms. The Nighthawk X10 AD7200 required no such reboot. I was able to launch Netgear’s routerlogin.net site as soon as I plugged in the Ethernet cable, and the setup process was almost entirely automated after that.</p><p> The Nighthawk X10 did require a firmware update as soon as I got it set up, but that only took a couple of minutes. You’ll also have to budget some extra time if you want to dig into additional features, like the built-in Plex Media Server, but the basic setup process is over really fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RfTANl22rAcY7Xy986eYa_62r44=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_WirelessRouters_NighthawkX10AD7200_02-1721b933d315435f98631847bf3ebb0b.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 (R9000)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Connectivity-AD7200-tri-band-with-MU-MIMO-and-10G-SFP"><a href="#Connectivity-AD7200-tri-band-with-MU-MIMO-and-10G-SFP" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: AD7200 tri-band with MU-MIMO and 10G SFP+"></a><strong>Connectivity: AD7200 tri-band with MU-MIMO and 10G SFP+</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is an AD7200 tri-band router, which means it’s capable of providing 1733Mbps over a 5GHz wireless network, 800Mbps over a 2.4GHz network, and a blistering 4600Mbps over a 60Hz network. That last one is the key feature here, as only 802.11ad routers like this one feature a super-high-speed 60GHz network.</p><p> If you aren’t familiar with 802.11ad, it’s a completely different standard from the more common 802.11ax. While 802.11ax is the successor to 802.11ac, the 802.11ad standard found in this router is a specialized offshoot that offers extremely high speeds and very short distances.</p><p> Also referred to as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-60-ghz-wireless-network-protocols-817936" >WiGig <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> due to its high speeds, 802.11ad supports speeds of up to 7Gbps and transmission distances of up to 30 feet when beamforming is employed, but real-world performance typically maxes out around 15 to 20 feet, and can’t pass through walls or other obstructions.</p><p> In addition to the 60GHz WiGig band, this router also creates simultaneous 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks for your devices that don’t support WiGig, which is likely to be either most or all of them.</p><p> In addition to the 60GHz WiGig band, this router also creates simultaneous 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks for your devices that don’t support WiGig, which is likely to be either most or all of them.</p><p> For physical connectivity, the Nighthawk X10 features six Ethernet ports, two of which can be used together to create a single 2Gbps connection. You also get two USB 3.0 ports for connecting USB drives and a single 10Gbps SFP+ LAN port. This final port is potentially the most interesting, and also most niche since it allows you to connect a high-speed NAS server, a secondary switch for more Ethernet ports, or other devices that require a bunch of high-speed bandwidth.</p><h2 id="Network-Performance-Fantastic-5GHz-performance-WiGig-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Network-Performance-Fantastic-5GHz-performance-WiGig-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Network Performance: Fantastic 5GHz performance, WiGig leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Network Performance: Fantastic 5GHz performance, WiGig leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> Since this is an 802.11ad router, and the 60GHz WiGig network is the key feature here, that’s where I’m going to start. All of my tests are performed using a 1Gbps Mediacom cable internet connection, so any testing done on an 802.11ad router like this involves data transfer speeds within my network, not the internet connection. For testing purposes, I have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that I retrofitted with a network interface card featuring the QCA9005 chipset.</p><p> Using my test laptop, I was able to connect to the Nighthawk X10’s 60GHz network and measure speeds that topped out at 4.6Gbps. The issue is that in order to maintain a solid connection and record connection speeds anywhere close to 4.6Gbps, I had to place the router on the desk right next to the laptop.</p><p> With the router in its normal position, just a few feet away from my desk, I was only able to manage a transfer speed of a little bit over 1Gbps. Moving my test laptop a bit further away resulted in a dip to barely 300Mbps, and the connection struggled to work at all at a distance of 10 feet with no obstructions.</p><p> The bottom line is that this router provides truly awesome speeds at very short distances, but the benefit falls off sharply, and you’d be better off using the 5GHz network even a few feet away.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Jwl6BD38cWznmN0op6bpzAmBs_U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_WirelessRouters_NighthawkX10AD7200_03-4cfe683a7cf94e94b14c0ec2be12da50.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 (R9000)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p> To the Nighthawk X10’s credit, the 5GHz network performance exceeded my wildest expectations. Using my 1Gbps Mediacom cable internet connection, I measured a relatively mediocre 373Mbps down and 73.6Mbps up. At the same time, using a wired connection to the same router, I measured 536.8Mbps down.</p><p> Moving about 10 feet away from the router, with a closed-door in the way, the download speed increased to 405Mbps, with 62Mbps up. At about 50 feet out, with several walls, appliances, and pieces of furniture in the way, the connection held strong at 310Mbps down and 49.6Mbps up. That’s one of the best results I’ve seen out of all the 5GHz routers I’ve tested.</p><p> For my final test, I took my phone down to my garage at a distance of about 100 feet, with an unreasonable amount of obstructions between the router and the device. At this distance, most routers fail to connect at all, struggle to maintain a connection, or kick me to the 2.4GHz band.</p><p> The Nighthawk X10 held strong though, dropping the download speed to 38.8Mbps and the upload speed to 13.1Mbps, but without touching the ping, barely increasing jitter, and introducing just 1.2 percent packet loss. Strangely enough, this 802.11ad router’s strongest selling point might be the impressively robust nature of its 5GHz network.</p><p> Strangely enough, this 802.11ad router’s strongest selling point might be the impressively robust nature of its 5 GHz network.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Netgear’s-web-interface-and-web-app-plus-Plex-and-more"><a href="#Software-Netgear’s-web-interface-and-web-app-plus-Plex-and-more" class="headerlink" title="Software: Netgear’s web interface and web app, plus Plex and more"></a><strong>Software: Netgear’s web interface and web app, plus Plex and more</strong></h2><p> Like its other offerings, Netgear gives you the option to manage the Nighthawk X10 using a web interface or a smartphone app. I used the web interface, and I found it fairly easy to understand and navigate if a bit slow.</p><p> The web portal provides you with basic and advanced tabs, with the basic tab giving you a big picture overview of the router’s status. It shows whether or not the internet is connected, the status of your wireless networks, how many devices are attached, and then gives you a bit of information on the status of the parental controls, the ReadySHARE feature for connecting USB drives, and your guest network.</p><p> Digging into advanced settings is more complicated, and you may find yourself reaching for documentation to find some options that are buried beneath several levels of menus.</p><p> Beyond the basics, this router comes with Plex Media Server built right in, and you can access and configure it through the main Netgear web portal. The way it works is that you can plug storage media into the Nighthawk X10 via the USB ports or the 10G SFP+ port and then stream media directly to Plex clients.</p><p> Aside from the robust 5GHz network, the built-in Plex server is definitely the strongest feature included with this router. I plugged in one of my media-filled SSD USB drives and had no trouble streaming to any of the Plex clients I have on my network.</p><p> I plugged in one of my media-filled SSD USB drives and had no trouble streaming to any of the Plex clients I have on my network.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134229/18498" target="_top" id="2134229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134229/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-if-you-really-need-802-11ad"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-if-you-really-need-802-11ad" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad if you really need 802.11ad"></a><strong>Price: Not bad if you really need 802.11ad</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $500, and a street price closer to $250, the Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is a tough sell to most consumers. It features a wireless technology that hasn’t really caught on, and which most consumers just won’t be able to take advantage of. For the money you’d spend on this router, you could get a high-end 802.11ax router.</p><p> If you do have use for an 802.11ad router, then $250 isn’t that bad of a price tag, especially considering the fantastic 5GHz performance and the convenient inclusion of Plex Media Server. I wouldn’t recommend upgrading your existing equipment to 802.11ad just to use this router, but the Nighthawk X10 makes a fine choice if you already have the hardware to support it.</p><p> By way of comparison, the Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR700 has similar specifications, swaps out Plex Media Server for some gaming-centric quality of life (QoL) features, and has a street price that’s close to $400.</p><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X10-AD7200-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX80"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X10-AD7200-vs-Netgear-Nighthawk-RAX80" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 vs. Netgear Nighthawk RAX80"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 vs. Netgear Nighthawk RAX80</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $400, and a street price closer to $350, the Nighthawk RAX80 (see on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MQDZXA4?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4846418%7Cnd55a891e250641509ef77229001ead8021%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is in the same general territory as the Nighthawk X10. The big difference between these competing Nighthawk devices is that one is an 802.11ad router, and the other is an 802.11ax router.</p><p> In terms of real-world 5GHz performance, the Nighthawk X10 actually blows the Nighthawk RAX80 out of the water. It’s important to note that testing was done with 802.11ac devices that couldn’t take full advantage of the Nighthawk RAX80’s full capabilities, but I measured significantly slower speeds from the Nighthawk RAX80 in my 50-foot test, and it wasn’t even able to maintain a 5GHz connection at all in my garage.</p><p> The bottom line here is that the Nighthawk X10 is remarkably good with 5GHz 802.11ac devices, and it’s a good choice if you have 802.11ad devices, but the Nighthawk RAX80 is a better value looking into the future since it supports 802.11ax.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Strong 5GHz performance and Plex Media Center make this a good option if you need an 802.11ad router.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X10 AD7200 is a bit of a mixed bag since its key feature is so niche. If you really need an 802.11ad router, you may want to look for one with a stronger range. However, this router has fantastic performance on the 5GHz band, and the Plex Media Server implementation is also a very strong plus. If short-range 802.11ad support with excellent fallback 5GHz performance sounds good to you, then this is the router you’re looking for.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136625/26400" target="_top" id="2136625">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136625" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136625/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X10 AD7200 Router</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  R9000</li><li>Price  $499.99</li><li>Weight  4.11 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.8 x 6.6 x 2.9 in.</li><li>Speed  60GHz: 4,600Mbps;

No, it wasn’t the most powerful headset out there, using a two-year-old smartphone processor to power its games and experiences, but it was a capable, completely self-contained, wireless VR headset that didn’t require a PC or game console to deliver stellar immersion.</p><p> It was one of last year’s greatest new gadgets, and now Oculus has returned with a sequel. The Oculus Quest 2 is smaller and lighter, yet more powerful and with a much better screen—yet it costs $100 less than the original. How did that happen? Well, it’s not all great news, thanks to a couple of cost-cutting measures that you’ll feel and potentially see, but the end result is ultimately a better and more affordable device that serves as an ideal gateway into VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-Compromises-were-made" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort: Compromises were made"></a>Design and Comfort: Compromises were made</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 sticks to the familiar modern VR playbook as a module that you strap onto your face to immerse yourself within its digital worlds but features some different material and construction choices than the original. Unfortunately, the design choices largely are not upgrades compared to the original headset</p><p> Noticeably, the module itself doesn’t jut out as far from your face as before, plus it has a white plastic finish rather than the black fabric-lined exterior of the original. It also weighs less, which is a good thing for a device that hangs off of your face: it comes in at 503g compared to 571g with the original Quest.</p><p> However, the shallower depth of the module makes an impact for someone like me who must wear glasses while using the Quest 2.</p><p> Even with the included, optional glasses spacer, which adds a couple extra millimeters between the lenses and where the padded visor presses against your face, the inside felt much tighter against my glasses. It can be tricky to get the Quest 2 on without my eyelashes brushing against my lenses.</p><p> But that’s also due in part to the new fabric strap system, which is less effective than the rubber, dome-like strap from the first Quest. That previous strap did a better job of cupping the back of your head to offset the weight of the module itself and keep it comfortably strapped to your head, but these loose, adjustable fabric straps aren’t nearly as secure. It took me longer to get the headset on and in a comfortable position, and I couldn’t find the same kind of sweet spot as before.</p><p> Oculus now sells a $49 Elite Strap attachment that’s more akin to the original Quest strap, and while the Quest 2 straps are usable, I’ll probably make the upgrade and buy the better strap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JkgQv_Sk0ofSL0Sp-jKmqe84xak=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-2-a7792535288542dba45c8bc32f882be2.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Rift 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks"><a href="#Tracking-and-Controllers-Some-improvements-some-drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks"></a>Tracking and Controllers: Some improvements, some drawbacks</h2><p> The Oculus Quest 2 uses the same kind of “inside-out” tracking system that relies on four cameras on the visor to track the wireless controllers or even your hands, rather than relying on external tracking sensors as some PC-based systems do. Like the original, it works amazingly well, allowing for fluid, six-degrees-of-freedom movement in games and minimizing both initial setup and the time it takes to get going each session. It also means that you can use the Oculus Quest 2_anywhere_ without the need for any kind of external hardware or accessories.</p><p> The Quest 2’s wireless, motion-sensing Oculus Touch controllers are identical in function to the original, but are a little heavier and have a larger surface with space to rest your thumb when not in use. That’s handy. Each has an analog stick and two face buttons, along with a trigger button and a grip button. Oculus also swapped out the magnetically-attached battery doors from the first Quest controllers—which would sometimes slide open when I used the original—for ones that simply click into place. That’s a win for function over form.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1aG6kdNHMuvnim8p8_i1RwH9QG8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-3-eec6cabc11db4ed9be5254aa2bc46ec1.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2 "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036501/19272" target="_top" id="2036501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036501/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> But there is a potential loss for function and comfort with one other particular aspect of the headset itself: IPD adjustment. Inter-pupillary distance, or IPD, is the physical distance between your eyes, and a headset must account for it to effectively deliver clear, 3D experiences. On the original Quest, a physical slider let you precisely adjust the distance to match your own face. With the Quest 2, however, there are just three settings, and you can physically shift the placement of the lenses to choose the position that is closest to your own.</p><p> If your IPD matches or is very close to one of the settings (58mm, 63mm, 68mm), then you’re all set. If not, then you may notice that the image isn’t as clear as you’d like, and it could potentially lead to headaches if you can’t find a pretty good sweet spot. In my case, my IPD is close enough to the middle setting to be OK, but it doesn’t feel as spot-on as it did on the original Quest using the slider. It might help knock down the price of the headset, but that’s a quality-of-life downgrade that will affect some people significantly more than others.</p><p> That might sound like a lot of griping, but it’s only because some of the key physical design changes on the Quest 2 feel like compromises or downgrades. But for most people, they won’t be significant impediments. And if you’re coming to the new headset without ever using the original Quest, then you should be fine—the new straps are usable, but they aren’t as effective or effortlessly adjustable as before. Luckily, the Quest 2 makes significant strides elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gwWuuSfTzWNDoS45b-iG9qG32-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-4-27f169e7e71b4372a38e13332b7b1364.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-phone…-and-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook"></a>Setup Process: You’ll need a phone… and Facebook</h2><p> You should charge the Oculus Quest 2 out of the box, as the modest total battery life means a partially-charged headset isn’t going to last very long. You will need a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >smartphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , either Android or iPhone, and the free Oculus app to complete setup, as well. Once the headset has a good charge, begin setup from the mobile app and then follow the guided directions, which will involve putting on, adjusting, and getting familiar with the headset itself.</p><p> Part of the setup process, and the process each time you use the headset, is to designate your play space by “drawing” a barrier within the augmented view of your surroundings seen through the headset’s cameras. From there, the headset determines whether you have enough space for active, room-scale experiences, or you can choose a stationary setup for seated play modes. During active play, a virtual barrier called the Oculus Guardian appears when you get close to the edges of your designated play space to help you avoid crashing into your surroundings. It’s all rather clever and effective.</p><p> There’s one other potential hitch with the Oculus Quest 2 that wasn’t present with the original: the new headset_requires_ a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tutorial-how-facebook-works-2654610" >Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and there’s no way around it. Facebook owns Oculus, and while the first Quest could be used simply with an Oculus account, the new one requires the social media account. For some, that may be a deal-breaker, given frustrations over privacy and the increasing role that Facebook plays in our society, so just know that going in.</p><h2 id="Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade"><a href="#Performance-It’s-a-big-upgrade" class="headerlink" title="Performance: It’s a big upgrade"></a>Performance: It’s a big upgrade</h2><p> The original Oculus Quest did a fine job of delivering immersive VR experiences that didn’t feel compromised or significantly downgraded, even if it didn’t hit the same visual peaks as pricier, PC-powered headsets. And it was pretty amazing that the Quest did so with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a chip found in 2017’s flagship smartphones.</p><p> The Oculus Quest 2 takes things to another level, and there are a few reasons why.</p><p> First off, the new Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chip here is based on the current Snapdragon 865 chip seen in phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Note20, and is three generations newer than the old chip.</p><p> It’s also paired with 50 percent more RAM (6GB) than the original Quest. Even more vividly, the fast-switching LCD screen packs in nearly 50 percent more pixels per eye than the old OLED panels did, for a noticeably crisper and smoother experience.</p><p> On the first Quest, you got 1440x1600 resolution per eye: solid, but a bit fuzzy and comparatively lower resolution than some of the PC headsets on the market. Here, however, the single screen provides 1832x1920 per eye, and the difference is obvious. While the switch from OLED to LCD technology should weaken the contrast a bit and dampen the deep black levels, I’ll be honest: I didn’t notice.</p><p> What I did notice was sharper interfaces and smoother action, with more fluid-feeling experiences that exhibited fewer of the occasional-yet-tolerable hitches seen with some games and apps on the first Quest headset.</p><p> Additionally, Oculus recently enabled the Quest 2 to hit a peak 90Hz screen refresh rate, up from 72Hz on the first headset, which will only help deliver that smoother-feeling usage. Developers must enable 90Hz within their apps and games, however.</p><p> I felt the Quest 2’s enhancements more prominently in some games over others. Laser sword-swinging music game Beat Saber, for example, ran well on the first headset and isn’t that different here—just smoother and clearer-looking. But with the online battle royale shooter Population: One, the cleaner-looking textures and more fluid performance helped mitigate some of the light motion sickness I felt playing on the first Quest.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Works-fine-without-headphones" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones"></a>Sound Quality: Works fine without headphones</h2><p> Plugging in headphones delivers a more closed-off, immersive experience, but the Oculus Quest 2’s built-in speaker does a solid job of delivering audio and music. It does sound a tiny bit louder and fuller than the original Quest’s speaker, but not significantly so. Still, if you want to play without being fully shut-off from your surroundings, it works just fine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours"><a href="#Battery-You’ll-get-a-couple-hours" class="headerlink" title="Battery: You’ll get a couple hours"></a>Battery: You’ll get a couple hours</h2><p> Like the original headset, the Oculus Quest 2 is rated for 2-3 hours of usage on a full charge. For such a compact, standalone headset, I think that’s reasonable. You get a couple hours to play, and then you can take a breather and do other things while it charges.</p><p> That said, if you’re keen on longer-lasting experiences, Oculus sells a $129 version of the Elite Strap with a built-in battery pack that doubles the play time, or you can get a portable battery pack, plug it in, and stick it in your pocket during use. Lastly, you could just use a lengthy USB-C cable and plug yourself into a wall. If you’re doing room-scale VR games and apps with free movement, however, you’ll need something longer—like 10 feet or more. Otherwise, some seated apps and games will work just fine when you’re tethered to a nearby wall outlet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ns2S3DQVema5UEDDSO8n3N7SC_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-7-0a0e40b6a3064fe7abc985f0900dbeff.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC"><a href="#Software-Use-the-headset-or-connect-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Software: Use the headset or connect to PC"></a>Software: Use the headset or connect to PC</h2><p> The headset’s own interface hasn’t changed much from the first Quest, taking place in a 3D home-like environment with floating menus that you can access via the motion controllers. It’s a pretty easy way to choose between your currently installed games and apps, install anything else in your library, purchase and download new content, and access video content including apps like Netflix, YouTube, and SlingTV.</p><p> Oculus has also enabled optional hand tracking, including the use of hand and finger gestures to get around the interface and interact with some games. Hand tracking is definitely more finicky than using the controllers, however, and you’ll need solid lighting to really rely on it. That said, it does still feel experimental, and I encountered enough misread gestures and incorrect interactions to make me want to stick to the controllers. They work reliably great.</p><p> Since the original Quest’s launch, Oculus added the ability to connect the headset to a powerful PC to run more advanced VR experiences, and that carries over to the Quest 2, as well. You’ll need a PC that is capable of running headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/valve-index-review-4775604" >Valve Index <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as either the official Oculus Link USB-C cable ($80) or a comparable USB 3.1 cable that can handle the high-speed demands. I bought an unofficial cable for half the price on Amazon, and it worked great.</p><p> Using a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-blade-15-review-4845229" >Razer Blade 15 (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, I was able to play the visually demanding and deeply immersive Half-Life: Alyx on the Oculus Quest 2—a game that it could never run using its own internal hardware. It ran a little less smoothly than it did using the PC-native Valve Index headset, but not significantly so. This is a great way to experience higher-end VR games, including the new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/star-wars-squadrons-review-5086656" >Star Wars: Squadrons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for example. And with Oculus announcing plans to phase out PC-only headsets, it will also be a key part of the Quest platform’s future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/72vxixVr7kdKoLfUC3QkIrBl26I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-6-12fcb6054cf2475191bc613a3f26bcfc.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><p> The $299 edition of the headset comes with 64GB of internal storage and the $399 version nets you 256GB, with some of each tally taken up by system software and resources. Luckily, the games and apps themselves aren’t huge, typically weighing in between 1-4GB apiece, sometimes less, and they’re pretty quick to download again if you want to revisit something. The 64GB edition should provide enough space for most players, as you could probably comfortably have a dozen or more games installed, along with streaming media apps, but anyone who wants to have a robust VR library on hand at all times without waiting might consider spending the extra cash.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902278/19272" target="_top" id="1902278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902278/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Games-A-good-growing-selection"><a href="#Games-A-good-growing-selection" class="headerlink" title="Games: A good, growing selection"></a>Games: A good, growing selection</h2><p> Although those aforementioned games and some others are still only found on PC (or maybe PlayStation VR on the PlayStation 4 or 5), the Oculus Quest platform has amassed a very nice selection of native games that you can download and play right on the headset.There is no difference in compatibility between the headsets: all Quest games play on Quest 2 and vice versa, just with performance differences.</p><p> Many of the early games from the impressive Quest launch lineup are still among the best games you can play on the Quest 2. The aforementioned Beat Saber, which finds you swinging your controllers to slash faux lightsabers through soaring rhythmic beats, is a frenetic blast, now with a larger library of songs including BTS and Linkin Park packs. Superhot VR is a stylish hybrid of a shooter and a puzzle game, of sorts, as you figure out how to clear through foes while avoiding incoming bullets that only move when you do. Meanwhile, the Star Wars VR game Vader Immortal still does a great job of creating an authentic atmosphere.</p><p> But there’s so much more now, too. Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite, both from developer Enhance Games, are trippy, trancelike experiences that you can sit down and really savor in VR. Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and the aforementioned Population: One show that larger-scale shooter experiences can be immersive and compelling in VR, plus there’s a newer Star Wars game, Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, that blends interactive storytelling with fun blaster battles.</p><p> There’s a lot of great stuff on Quest 2, ranging from simple arcade-like experiences to larger-scale adventures, quirky interactive experiences, and more. And on top of that, there are the aforementioned video services for 360-degree videos, plus fitness apps and games, VR chat for communicating with friends and random people, a web browser, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FqVvo044zoPghSD_PR1g2e0L2rs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-5-216bbf638cbe407b8b6f332abc94ae47.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Price-It’s-an-amazing-value"><a href="#Price-It’s-an-amazing-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: It’s an amazing value"></a>Price: It’s an amazing value</h2><p> The Oculus Quest was already impressively priced at $399, so launching the more powerful Oculus Quest 2 at $299 is pretty phenomenal. Granted, the design compromises are a little frustrating, and I would’ve rather paid more for a better strap and more precise IPD settings like on the original—but those are the tweaks made to try and broaden the market for the Quest and VR as a whole. Still, even with those design annoyances, the Quest 2 is an incredible value for a portable, fully self-contained VR game console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TDsFPvRGkhZaFzIaNnKRk1_xO4s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Oculus-Quest-2-VR-Headset-8-Comparison-1b0c51b029da41389167e103a4c4843a.jpg"                      alt="Oculus Quest 2"                ></p><p> Andrew Hayward &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139108/17108" target="_top" id="2139108">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139108" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139108/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR"><a href="#Oculus-Quest-2-vs-PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR"></a>Oculus Quest 2 vs. PlayStation VR</h2><p> Amazingly, there is no direct analog to the Oculus Quest 2 on the market: Oculus seems to be the only company that can release such a powerful device at this kind of price and with this kind of software support. That said, if I had to compare it to another VR headset, I’d put it up against Sony’s PlayStation VR, which requires a PlayStation 4 or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-5-review-5088394" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> console.</p><p> The PSVR is a few years old now and is technically overshadowed by the Quest 2 in terms of screen and controller quality. Still, Sony has amassed some stellar exclusive games thanks to its partnerships with game developers, and the PlayStation VR is a solid, reasonably affordable pickup for anyone who already has a PS4 or PS5 console and wants to dabble in VR. But if you don’t already have the console, and you want to get into VR, go for the dedicated Quest 2 instead. It’ll be cheaper than buying a headset and console together, plus it’s a better VR experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sony-playstation-vr-review-4692684" >Sony PlayStation VR Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best VR device, all things considered.</strong></p><p> The significant performance upgrade and surprising price drop outweigh some of the annoying design shifts with the Oculus Quest 2, making it the must-have VR headset for just about everyone. Not only does it play a great library of on-headset games, but it can also connect to a powerful PC to play even more games on top of that. Add to that the ease of use, quality gameplay, and immersive visuals, and the Oculus Quest 2 is another brilliant VR game console.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a
