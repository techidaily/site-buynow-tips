Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is so cumbersome, unsightly, and complicated that I secretly wanted it to fail. Despite my attempts to judge this book by its cover, however, it was one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of all the ones I tested. Serves me right I suppose.</p><p> If you live far enough from your local TV signal source that other indoor antennas have failed you, the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might actually provide some help. Buyers should probably make sure that they can’t get away with a smaller, cheaper, simpler solution first, but if or when that fails, this antenna definitely gets the job done.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vY1j7QoS0FLwOKNhPlSfR3XMlmo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_02-e97897fe03b74f5faa2eefad3b3b7208.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068408/7443" target="_top" id="2068408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future"><a href="#Design-Glimpsing-an-ugly-future" class="headerlink" title="Design: Glimpsing an ugly future"></a><strong>Design: Glimpsing an ugly future</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna looks something like what I would imagine a space prison to look like. It’s far larger than any of the other antennas that I tested, and during every step of the assembly I kept thinking to myself “well that part can’t possibly be necessary.” From the comically long antennas and giant metal grate, to the bulbous hollowed out spheres, there is a lot going on here.</p><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup.</p><p> As you’ll see later though, this is because the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna doesn’t really care about looks. Everything is 100% about function. There are, however, a few little elements from a design perspective that help make the ClearStream a somewhat thoughtful device nonetheless. Once assembled, all the parts fit together nicely like a lego set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1838960/17916" target="_top" id="1838960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1838960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1838960/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Buckle-up"><a href="#Setup-Buckle-up" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Buckle up"></a><strong>Setup: Buckle up</strong></h2><p> Setup of the ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has by far the most complicated setup of the antennas that I tested in our roundup. The instructions that come included have illustrations that show how everything fits together, but it isn’t outlined in the simplest manner possible.</p><p> Like a piece of IKEA furniture, the specific orientation of a lot of parts matter, even if they appear to fit together multiple ways. The manual doesn’t do a fantastic job of explaining this, and I could see it leading to some frustration. Once you get the cage in place and secured, the rest of it comes together fairly easily though.</p><p> Once the entire device is assembled, the real work begins in my opinion. Now you have to figure out how and where to mount this beast of an antenna. Antenna’s Direct has you covered here, including a hefty bracket and swiveling mast that will help you mount the antenna to just about anywhere with a flat surface that you don’t mind screwing some bolts into.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098705/14409" target="_top" id="2098705">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098705" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098705/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Top-tier"><a href="#Performance-Top-tier" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Top tier"></a><strong>Performance: Top tier</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception. I tested the antenna indoors along with the rest of the suite of indoor antennas, and in the same orientation. Perhaps it would have benefited from being placed outside, but in the interest of fairness I used the same method for all.</p><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna might be an unsightly space jail, but it sure gets good reception.</p><p> In my channel acquisition test, the ClearStream managed 76 channels consistently, far and away the best result from any of the devices I tested. The worst antenna I tested picked up just 47 channels, and the second best, 69. Needless to say, all the wires, cages, and bulbous plastic spheres are clearly doing something here, because this was the best result I saw.</p><h2 id="Range-Extensive"><a href="#Range-Extensive" class="headerlink" title="Range: Extensive"></a><strong>Range: Extensive</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna is rated for up to 60 miles. These ratings are generally based on relatively unobstructed paths between the signal and your device. There is a lot less than 60 miles between me and my local TV broadcast source, but if the other results are any indication, the ClearStream has a fighting chance at living up to these claims.</p><p><img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NoQoQy3-EFUpi1z9oMTpD2JGWHQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_ClearStream_04-70f5a48ac9a347d286c71240b85cbc1c.jpg" alt="ClearStream 2V Indoor/Outdoor HDTV Antenna"></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap"><a href="#Price-Performance-doesn’t-come-cheap" class="headerlink" title="Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap"></a><strong>Price: Performance doesn’t come cheap</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna has a list price of $120 and a 90-day rolling average price on Amazon of $83. This is significantly more than any of the other antennas I tested, some of which could be had for around $25. If you live far enough that you need a better performing antenna, however, it could easily be worth every penny. I would only caution buyers to make sure they really do need this performance before pulling the trigger on this very large antenna.</p><h2 id="ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-2V-Indoor-Outdoor-HDTV-Antenna-vs-1byone-Digital-Amplified-Indoor-HD-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna vs 1byone Digital Amplified Indoor HD TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> I figured it might be interesting to compare the cheapest antenna to the most expensive antenna. If you are living inside of a city, fairly close to a signal source, you can probably get away with a cheaper antenna like the $25 amplified antenna by manufacturer 1byone. This flat, simple antenna takes up far less space and still managed to get 59 channels. It also maintained a clear picture on all of the major network stations just fine.</p><p> If you live further or in a more obstructed path, however, the 1byone probably wouldn’t cut it at all. It’s rather all-or-nothing. If you do genuinely need a more capable antenna, it could be make or break for your TV-viewing experience.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Great performance for those that need it.</strong><br> The ClearStream 2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna isn’t the cheapest or best-looking antenna on the market, but it gets the job done better than any of the other antennas we tested. Buyers who know they need an antenna with better range and performance will find this to be a noticeable bump from cheaper indoor antennas.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  2V Indoor&#x2F;Outdoor HDTV Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  ClearStream</li><li>Price  $120.00</li><li>Release Date  April 2012</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  60 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-social-media-connections-instagram-and-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering Social Media Connections Instagram & TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-5-preferred-sites-to-download-dynamic-and-versatile-text-effects/"><u>[Updated] 5 Preferred Sites to Download Dynamic and Versatile Text Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfecting-pixels-lighting-setup-secrets-unveiled/"><u>2024 Approved Perfecting Pixels Lighting Setup Secrets Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/amplify-volume-for-twitters-silent-videos/"><u>Amplify Volume for Twitter's Silent Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/chatgpt-sessions-archiving-how-to-keep-a-record-for-future-reference/"><u>ChatGPT Sessions Archiving: How to Keep a Record for Future Reference</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/step-by-step-transition-elevating-your-pc-from-windows-8-to-11/"><u>Step-by-Step Transition: Elevating Your PC From Windows 8 to 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/survival-or-skid-exploring-the-zombie-apocalypse-in-days-gone-as-an-adventurous-rider/"><u>Survival or Skid: Exploring the Zombie Apocalypse in 'Days Gone' As an Adventurous Rider</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-essential-review-of-speed-and-style-the-gotrax-gxl-v2-commuter-e-scooter-unveiled/"><u>The Essential Review of Speed and Style: The Gotrax GXL V2 Commuter E-Scooter Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-simplicity-and-power-combo-insights-from-the-clearstream-eclipse-antenna-critique/"><u>The Simplicity and Power Combo: Insights From the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna Critique</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/why-your-whatsapp-location-is-not-updating-and-how-to-fix-on-vivo-x90s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Why Your WhatsApp Location is Not Updating and How to Fix On Vivo X90S | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Read on to see our results.</em></p><p> The Mac mini (M1, 2020) is the first Mac desktop to receive Apple’s new<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/why-apple-designed-the-m1-chip-5087225" >ARM-based M1 chip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s also the most affordable way to dip your toe into the brave new world of Apple Silicon, even though it’s powered by the exact same chip found in the much more expensive MacBook Pro. It can’t<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/using-boot-camp-assistant-install-windows-2260115" >run Windows apps via Bootcamp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like an Intel Mac, and there will be some growing pains as developers switch gears and start catering to the new hardware, but that hardware offers tremendous raw performance, excellent potential in the long term, and more than acceptable real-world performance in the short term.</p><p> While I was a bit skeptical of Apple’s decision to leave Intel behind, the promised performance of their custom silicon left me eager to dig in and see how that raw power really translates into real-world situations. I was able to spend about a week with an M1 Mac mini as my main work machine, plugging in my keyboard and monitors, with my primary rig left to gather dust for the duration.</p><p> During my time with the M1 Mac mini, I paid close attention to performance, of course, with a special eye to how well it handles non-native apps and apps that were designed for iOS. The lack of support for Bootcamp meant I wasn’t able to completely leave my old hardware behind, but there’s no getting around it: this is some impressive hardware at any price, let alone a price tag that’s cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aEGPK4B55KCbhrof83878utZpZQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-2-16eb4e84f8694bb6a76cf078906add40.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111981/7443" target="_top" id="2111981">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111981" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111981/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis"><a href="#Design-Same-sleek-aluminum-chassis" class="headerlink" title="Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis"></a>Design: Same sleek aluminum chassis</h2><p> The big changes here are all under the hood, as Apple opted to leave the overall design of the Mac mini (M1, 2020) unchanged from the previous model. It’s still a block of milled aluminum with the same rounded corners, satin finish, and shiny Apple logo emblazoned on the top. The top is smooth and unmarked aside from the logo, and the front and sides of the case are completely featureless aside from a small LED on the front that lets you know when the system is powered on.</p><p> The ports are all found around the back, where the aluminum case is cut away to accommodate a black plastic panel. There you’ll find a power button and socket for the power cable, an Ethernet port, two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt 3 ports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , an HDMI port, two USB type A ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Situated just below this array of inputs is a cutout that reveals the internal heatsink.</p><p> The biggest change here from the last iteration of the hardware is that the last Mac mini featured four Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of just two. The configuration of the ports is even the same, drawing attention to the fact that just two ports occupy space that could easily support twice that number.</p><p> The bottom of the M1 Mac mini also remains unchanged from the last version of the hardware, with most of it taken up by a circular plastic cover that’s designed to allow easier access to the internals. As before, it causes the Mac mini to stand up a bit from whatever surface you place it on, and it has very little gripping power. If you place it on a slick surface, be aware that it could slide off with the slightest nudge.</p><p> Unlike the previous model, the M1 Mac mini doesn’t have any user serviceable parts or components. That means you’re stuck with the memory and storage configurations you choose at check out, and you can’t go back in later to add extra RAM or a bigger SSD.</p><p> The biggest disappointment here, aside from the fact that the M1 Mac mini didn’t receive any sort of aesthetic update, is that Apple removed two Thunderbolt ports and the ability to upgrade your memory. The first isn’t that big of an issue, since the Mac mini looked great before and still looks great. The lack of Thunderbolt ports, similarly, isn’t a huge deal, because there are a ton of ways to get around such a limitation. The lack of upgradeability certainly removes a degree of flexibility from the hardware, though, making it much more important to select the amount of memory and storage that you’ll be comfortable with for the life of the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xpt3pmIvU6FTBUo0tBDpyp3BERE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-3-844f657110aa424db6f1e5bac1b19eda.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087395/7443" target="_top" id="2087395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-painless-but-you-can’t-use-a-Bluetooth-keyboard-or-mouse" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse"></a>Setup Process: Fast and painless, but you can’t use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse</h2><p> If you’ve ever set up a macOS device before, the setup process isn’t any different here. It’s just a matter of accepting some terms, tweaking some initial settings, and connecting your Apple ID. As always, setup is going to be easier if you have access to another functional piece of Apple hardware that you’re already logged into.</p><p> The one wrinkle that you may run into is that you can’t set up the Mac mini with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. You’ll need to plug a wired keyboard and mouse in to complete the setup process and then pair your Bluetooth hardware, or use a keyboard and mouse combo that uses a wireless dongle.</p><p> For example, I was able to plug in the dongle from my Logitech K400+ Touch Keyboard, and the Mac mini recognized the peripheral immediately. That allowed me to complete the setup process without digging around for wired peripherals.</p><h2 id="Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups"><a href="#Performance-Unreal-performance-with-some-hiccups" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups"></a>Performance: Unreal performance with some hiccups</h2><p> While the Mac mini (M1, 2020) remained mostly unchanged from a design perspective, the internals received a massive overhaul. This is Apple’s first desktop to receive its new M1 chip, and that’s a really big deal. Though one of the M1’s headline features, reduced power use, isn’t as big a deal here as it is in the MacBook Air, this chip is still massively more powerful than anything you’ve ever seen in a Mac before. In fact, the Mac mini has the exact same chip as the MacBook Pro, with one more GPU core than the MacBook Air.</p><p> The M1 CPU features eight cores, including four performance cores and four efficiency cores, and the same chip also includes an eight core GPU.</p><p> This isn’t an Intel integrated graphics situation, though. The M1 boasts some pretty impressive processing power from both the CPU and GPU components. In real world terms, that translates to silky-smooth day to day operation from Big Sur, fast-loading and running apps, speedy video rendering and image editing, and intriguing possibilities in the realm of gaming.</p><p> While the numbers Apple has tossed around have been impressive, and my own experience with the M1 hardware was almost uniformly positive, I had to run some benchmarks. First up, I ran the Cinebench multi-core test. The Mac mini achieved a score of 7,662 in that test, putting it between an Intel Xeon E5-2697 at 3GHz and an X5650 Xeon processor at 3.66Ghz. That’s almost within spitting distance of an eight core AMD Ryzen 7 1700X, but only about half the score of a 1950X Threadripper.</p><p> For a processor in a mini-computer at this price range, the M1 turned in decent enough multi-core numbers. When running the single-core Cinebench test though, decent goes right out the window. In that test, the M1 Mac mini scored 1,521, which is the second highest score Cinebench has on record.</p><p> I also ran a few gaming benchmarks from GFXBench Metal. I started with Car Chase, which is a benchmark that simulates a 3D game with advanced shaders, lighting effects, and more. The M1 Mac mini scored a decent 60.44fps in that test, which would be entirely playable if we were dealing with a real game and not a benchmark. It scored a nearly identical 60fps in the less-intense T-Rex benchmark.</p><p> In addition to GFXBench, I also ran the WildLife benchmark from 3DMark that’s designed for iOS, made possible by Big Sur’s native support for iOS applications. In that test, the Mac mini scored 17,930 overall and registered 107fps. Both numbers were a bit higher than the MacBook Air managed on the same test, which is understandable since the Mac mini GPU has one more core.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H6vCqcN2s5HOQG5MJWawrPxairg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-6-cd1693bee2f4429fafd1a57ecffbce81.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Gaming-Limited-but-promising"><a href="#Gaming-Limited-but-promising" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: Limited but promising"></a>Gaming: Limited but promising</h2><p> This is one area where Apple’s decision to switch from Intel to their own bespoke silicon is unlikely to pay off for a while. The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it. That means the already anemic Mac gaming scene could be even more anemic until devs see a reason to put substantial resources into games that run natively on the ARM-based M1 hardware. In the long term, cross-compatibility between macOS and iOS apps could end up being a massive game-changer.</p><p> Since the gaming scene was already anemic on macOS, a lot of gaming on Macs is really done in Windows via Bootcamp. If you do a lot of gaming on your current Mac, you’re probably familiar with big tentpole video game titles that never make it off Windows in the first place, and afterthought macOS ports that are poorly optimized and run a whole lot better if you just play the same game on the same hardware in Windows.</p><p> With the switch to ARM-based architecture, the Mac mini no longer provides the option to run Windows alongside macOS, so that gaming option is gone. Windows can’t run on this hardware, so the only way to play Windows-only games is through a virtual machine environment, which is not a good way to play games. That means you just won’t be able to play some games if you rely on a Mac mini, or any M1-based Mac, as your only gaming rig.</p><p> The issue is that while the M1 chip is powerful, it’s going to take a while for game developers to offer any kind of real support for it.</p><p> However, thanks to Rosetta 2, the Mac mini can play any game that’s designed to run in macOS on an Intel machine. There’s some level of performance cost involved, but I wasn’t able to notice it with any of the games I played. Notably, I was able to run<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-steam-4177380" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using Rosetta 2 and then download and play macOS games through Steam seamlessly.</p><p> Civilization 6 is currently in the middle of a nearly year-long content drip, and I was able to fire it up via Rosetta 2 and Steam with zero issues. Even with the world size cranked up all the way, more civs than recommended, and maxed out city states, the M1 sailed along effortlessly with fast load times and tolerably snappy AI turns.</p><p> For something less demanding, yet much more fast-paced, I fired up Rocket League. Though Psyonix technically no longer supports macOS, I was able to download and launch through Steam, and set up a local match. It ran without a hitch, with zero slowdown or stuttering as the cars zipped around the arena at breakneck pace.</p><p> The last game I tried out was Streets of Rage 4, the long-awaited fourth entry in the Streets of Rage series that finally arrived earlier this year. The fast-paced online brawler ran just as smoothly as it does on my Windows gaming rig, with no lag or slow down at all.</p><p> Aside from lack of support from game developers, the only real drawback here in terms of gaming comes from the HDMI port itself. While the M1 Mac mini can pump out<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >4K graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. That’s fine for most casual gamers, but anyone who has fallen in love with their high refresh rate monitor will experience a bit of pain here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557746/17382" target="_top" id="1557746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557746/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Productivity-Ready-for-work"><a href="#Productivity-Ready-for-work" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Ready for work"></a>Productivity: Ready for work</h2><p> The great thing about the Mac mini line is that it’s always been so flexible. You can use a Mac mini for work, but the size and relative affordability of the hardware means you aren’t locked into using it that way. If you do aim to use an M1 Mac mini for work though, it’s more than up to the task. Native apps and the operating system itself run fast and smooth as you could possibly hope, with none of the sitting around looking at spinning beach balls that you may have gotten used to with older hardware.</p><p> Thanks to the emulation offered by Rosetta 2, the M1 offers most tools people will need for productivity. If you currently run an app in macOS on older hardware, Rosetta 2 will allow you to run it on an M1 Mac mini until a native app arrives. And even if a native app doesn’t arrive, your productivity shouldn’t be affected too much.</p><p> I was able to run apps like Photoshop and Lightroom through Rosetta 2 without a hitch or even a hint of slowdown.</p><p> Those are both examples of apps that will get native -versions, according to Adobe, but they run pretty well under Rosetta 2 in the meantime.</p><p> Multitasking also works flawlessly, and I was able to juggle an impressive number of browser windows, intensive apps like Photoshop and Handbrake, voice and video chat over Discord, and more without running into any real problems.</p><h2 id="Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it"><a href="#Audio-It’s-there-if-you-need-it" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It’s there if you need it"></a>Audio: It’s there if you need it</h2><p> The M1 Mac mini is great in almost every category, but audio isn’t one of them. There’s a speaker inside that sleek aluminum block, but it isn’t one you’ll care to listen to. It’s tinny and hollow, and absolutely a placeholder for more capable external speakers. You’ll want to hook up headphonesor some kind of speakers or soundbar shortly after setting the M1 Mac mini up, because the built-in speaker isn’t really even suitable for watching YouTube videos, let alone listening to music or streaming your favorite shows or movies.</p><p> The M1 Mac mini does include a 3.5mm headphone jack on the back along with built-in Bluetooth, so you have a lot of options. Just make sure to budget for some sort of external speakers or headphones, because you don’t want to get stuck with the built-in speaker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OZrKjTPGUmo00carhaedBa9WhTU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-5-bc84da59dfdf440c8d53a096509c232b.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><h2 id="Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Solid-Ethernet-and-Wi-Fi-6-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity"></a>Network: Solid Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</h2><p> The Mac mini includes a wired gigabit Ethernet jack, support for Bluetooth 5.0, and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network card that’s also 801.11a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&#x2F;n&#x2F;ac compatible. Performance from the wired and wireless networking options was uniformly strong, with fast download speeds and no issues streaming 4K video or video chatting.</p><p> To test the M1 Mac mini’s network capabilities, I used a gigabit connection from Mediacom that measured just shy of 1Gbps at the modem at the time of testing. First I hooked up to the router via Ethernet and checked the speed using the Speedtest app from Ookla. With the wired connection, the M1 Mac mini turned in an impressive 937Mbps down, which is one of the fastest measurements I’ve seen on this connection. At the same time, it measured an upload speed of 63.7Mbps, which is close to the upper limit of this connection.</p><p> I also tested the wireless connection, hooking the M1 Mac mini to my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/eero-pro-mesh-wi-fi-system-review-4797008" >Eero mesh network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Big Sur was built specifically for this hardware and to integrate seamlessly with Rosetta 2 for running legacy Intel macOS apps, and a number of first party Apple apps also run natively, but that’s about it at launch.</p><p> I’ve already touched on it a few times, but the biggest casualty of Apple’s move to in-house ARM-based silicon is that the hardware doesn’t let you dual boot Windows, and x86 emulation for Windows apps is also a no-go. The good news is that a new version of Parallels Desktop for Mac that will run on M1 hardware is on the way, but some apps require dual booting, or run poorly in a virtual machine environment, so that won’t solve every problem for everyone.</p><p> Software is the biggest stumbling block for M1 hardware during these early days, as there isn’t a whole lot out there that’s actually designed to run on Apple Silicon.</p><p> The bottom line is that if you currently rely on Bootcamp for a Windows application or utility that you need for work, or even just for gaming, the M1 Mac mini just won’t run that software for you. That may change in the future, as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/windows-runs-so-fast-on-m1-macs-it-s-embarrassing-5089804" >Windows does actually have an ARM version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but for the time being you’re out of luck in that department.</p><p> For the time being, the trade off is that Big Sur and native apps like Safari run extremely well, and with remarkably low power consumption and heat generation compared to Intel Macs.</p><h2 id="Price-More-affordable-than-ever"><a href="#Price-More-affordable-than-ever" class="headerlink" title="Price: More affordable than ever"></a>Price: More affordable than ever</h2><p> The Mac mini saw a price increase alongside its last major retool, but Apple actually played against tradition and handed us a price reduction with the transition to M1 hardware. The baseline M1 Mac mini is actually hundreds of dollars cheaper than the previous iteration of the hardware, which is remarkable considering how much more powerful it is. The last Intel Mac mini was already a good deal, so the even cheaper M1 Mac mini looks even better in comparison. Considering its capabilities, it’s also a good deal when compared to non-Apple mini desktop hardware like the Intel NUC lineup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/G2V98ugnO-cdk-GaL11FUP0RWvo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Mac-Mini-M1-2020-Computer-7-c899b9f13f09448699fee766ab51a2bd.jpg"                      alt="Mac mini"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135403/19272" target="_top" id="2135403">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135403" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135403/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jeremy Laukkonen &#x2F; Lifewire</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972698/19272" target="_top" id="1972698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mac-Mini-M1-vs-Mac-Mini-Intel"><a href="#Mac-Mini-M1-vs-Mac-Mini-Intel" class="headerlink" title="Mac Mini M1 vs. Mac Mini Intel"></a>Mac Mini M1 vs. Mac Mini Intel</h2><p> This is a bit of an unfair fight, but the fact is that Apple still sells the Intel Mac mini, so it’s a natural comparison to make. The two mini desktops share an identical form factor, with the Intel version coming in Space Gray and the M1 version finished in Silver. The Intel Mac mini has a base price of $1,099 compared to $699 or $899 for the M1 Mac mini.</p><p> The Intel Mac mini is more similar to the $899 model of the M1 hardware since both come with 512GB of storage. They also both have 8GB of RAM. Where the M1 Mac mini has the 8-core M1 chip, the Intel version includes a 6-core Intel Core i5 and integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630.</p><p> In terms of performance, the M1 Mac mini blows the Intel version out of the water. The Intel version does include a couple extra Thunderbolt ports though, and it can do one thing the M1 version can’t: run Windows via Bootcamp.</p><p> If you don’t have any need to run Windows apps, then there’s no real question. The M1 Mac mini is superior, and it costs less. The Intel Mac mini is worth considering if you absolutely need to run Windows apps and don’t mind the extra cost, but the question then becomes whether the Mac mini is really the best platform to be running those Windows apps considering how much more expensive it is than a pure Windows machine of similar capabilities.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mini-pcs-4047271" >The Best Home Theater PCs of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you’re weighing different options, be sure to check out our guide for the best laptops.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>If all you need is a Mac, the M1 Mac mini is your destination.</strong></p><p> The Apple Mac mini with M1 is a tremendously impressive piece of hardware, offering staggering performance at an affordable price. The only real catch here is that in leaving Intel behind, Apple may have left you in the lurch. If you currently can’t get by without running specific apps through Windows by way of Bootcamp, then the M1 Mac mini just isn’t what you’re looking for. If you can live and work in a world that’s entirely free of Windows, then the M1 Mac mini is ready to welcome you home.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-air-4-review-5091874" >Apple iPad Air 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Mac Mini</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>UPC  194252091746</li><li>Price  $699.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Weight  2.6 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.7 x 7.7 x 1.4 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1 year (limited)</li><li>Processor  Apple M1 chip w&#x2F;8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine</li><li>Storage  256GB SSD (optional 512GB - 2TB)</li><li>RAM  8GB (16GB optional)</li><li>Ports  Power, Ethernet, 2x USB-C&#x2F;Thunderbolt 2, 2xUSB-A HDMI</li><li>Connectivity  Wi-Fi 6, Ethernet</li><li>Software  macOS Big Sur</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-creative-text-amplification-tips/"><u>[New] Creative Text Amplification Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-do-youtubers-get-paid-monthly/"><u>2024 Approved Do YouTubers Get Paid Monthly?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-9-clandestine-content-getters/"><u>2024 Approved Premium 9 Clandestine Content Getters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-silence-a-comprehensive-walkthrough-for-eliminating-tracks-in-audacity/"><u>New 2024 Approved Mastering Silence A Comprehensive Walkthrough for Eliminating Tracks in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/premier-pro-basketball-simulation-nba/"><u>Premier Pro-Basketball Simulation: NBA</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/professional-photographers-choice-in-depth-look-at-the-dji-mavic-2-pro/"><u>Professional Photographer's Choice: In-Depth Look at the DJI Mavic 2 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/proven-guidelines-for-buying-capture-equipment/"><u>Proven Guidelines for Buying Capture Equipment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/revolutionize-your-gaming-setup-with-the-stunning-philips-49-inch-curved-oled-by-evga/"><u>Revolutionize Your Gaming Setup With the Stunning Philips 49-Inch Curved OLED by EVGA</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/simple-techniques-for-efficiently-taking-screenshots-on-your-hp-device/"><u>Simple Techniques for Efficiently Taking Screenshots on Your HP Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/windows-layering-effect-on-linux-adoption/"><u>Windows Layering Effect on Linux Adoption</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

We tested things like viewing angles, color reproduction, sound quality, and more to see if this budget Fire TV is really worth a sport in your living room.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MXH7eY7oDLeZbWXcastu1A7OhpQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-5-2ec275929e8543f0ab9c4ada6276d84c.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle"><a href="#Design-Thick-body-thick-bezel-but-light-enough-for-one-person-to-handle" class="headerlink" title="Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle"></a><strong>Design: Thick body, thick bezel, but light enough for one person to handle</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is thick and boxy, with a fairly wide bezel, and large feet that mount perpendicularly instead of angling like a lot of other inexpensive sets. It isn’t anything special to look at, but that’s to be expected from a budget line like Insignia. The good thing is that it’s fairly light, at less than 20 pounds, and the large feet make it quite steady.</p><p> Most of the ports are found on the left side of the set, as you face it, with a few of them oriented downward instead.</p><p> The power button is situated in a semi-translucent plastic bulge near one of the feet, making it easy to locate, and you can use the same button to switch inputs. There are no other physical buttons on this set, so don’t lose the remote.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones.</p><p> This television uses a standard detachable C7 power cord instead of a hard-wired power cable, and it features a standard 200 x 200 millimeter<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tv-wall-mounts-3276137" >VESA mount <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to ditch the clunky feet and hang it on a wall.</p><p> While this set does have Alexa built right in, it works like a Fire TV Stick and not like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-4172274" >Fire TV Cube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-amazon-echo-4147189" >Echo device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . What that means is it lacks far-field microphones, so you have to give commands via the remote. The remote itself is the same basic design that’s included with other Fire TV devices, but it includes volume buttons, a live TV button, and preset shortcuts for a few streaming services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8ovvGrqb8Me9IvWHrQc7UW02kw8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-4-acb78e6d55e4488ca394495d5c74c754.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-need-a-Phillips-screwdriver-and-your-Amazon-password" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll need a Phillips screwdriver and your Amazon password</strong></h2><p> Despite being a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-43-inch-tvs-4588664" >43-inch class television <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance. It’s even packed in a bag that has convenient handles, making it easy to lift up and out of the box and set carefully on a table for assembly.</p><p> This television comes more or less ready to go, but the feet have to be attached if you aren’t going to wall mount it. The feet are clearly marked as to which side needs to point toward the front of the television, and each one attaches with two Phillips screws. If you have a Phillips screwdriver at hand, you can have everything tightened up and the television standing up within a couple minutes.</p><p> Despite being a 43-inch class television, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is light enough for most people to handle and set up without any outside assistance.</p><p> Once the feet are on, or the television has been hung on a wall mount, it’s time to turn it on. This presents you with the Fire TV interface, so you should be ready to pick your favorite apps, connect to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430" >Wi-Fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or wired network, and then log into your Amazon account if you want to get the most out of your new television. There’s also a basic mode if you don’t have an Amazon account or just don’t want to log in.</p><p> The final part of the setup process involves waiting for your apps to download, and then allowing the Fire TV to download and install a firmware update. None of this is too terribly time consuming, but plan on setting aside at least 10 to 15 minutes before your TV is fully ready to watch.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired"><a href="#Image-Quality-Crystal-clear-and-beautiful-colors-but-HDR-leaves-a-bit-to-be-desired" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired"></a><strong>Image Quality: Crystal clear and beautiful colors, but HDR leaves a bit to be desired</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is a 4K UHD television with HDR support, and the picture quality is a massive improvement over lower resolution (1080p, 720p) televisions, especially if you have hardware or media that’s capable of taking advantage of the increased resolution. Game consoles like the 4K-capable Xbox One X and PS4 Pro look great, as do UHD Blu-rays.</p><p> We also loaded up Amazon Prime Video, which includes a bunch of 4K content if you don’t have any UHD devices. Watching an episode of The Tick, Peter Serafinowicz’s bright blue suit popped against the comparatively drab cityscape, and the action was clear and crisp as he bounded from building to building.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles.</p><p> Colors look great across all kinds of different content, but the contrast isn’t as good. Dark scenes seem a bit muddy, with areas that should be perfect black being lighter than they really should be.</p><p> While this set does have UHD support, it’s limited to HDR10 and doesn’t support local dimming. That means the HDR isn’t as effective as you’ll see in more expensive televisions, but it’s still great for a budget TV like this.</p><p> Viewing angles on our test unit were great, with a bit of noticeable color or brightness variation when viewing from up close and at extreme angles. When backed up to a more appropriate distance, we didn’t have any problem viewing this television from any seat in the house.</p><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Surprisingly-good-for-a-budget-set" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Surprisingly good for a budget set</strong></h2><p> Built-in television speakers usually aren’t very good, which is why soundbars are popular. That’s especially true of budget television sets, but the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 actually has decent audio quality. You’ll probably want to invest in a soundbar if you don’t already have one, but the sound quality is good enough that you can get by with the built-in speakers if you need to.</p><p> When watching shows on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and HBO Now, dialogue came through crystal clear, and sound effects had enough substance that we didn’t feel the need to immediately plug in a soundbar or reach for our Bluetooth headphones. We also loaded up Amazon Music, turned the volume up, and found that the speakers were loud enough to fill the room without any noticeable distortion. The speakers are definitely lacking in bass, but it’s still surprisingly good for a budget television.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/OfRGDj7hZY6nrkoT_HqDEM1S9Ts=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-2-8b38ffeb5ce44c0d9a6c7aa7f6dce4cd.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs"><a href="#Ports-Full-complement-of-digital-and-analog-inputs-and-outputs" class="headerlink" title="Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs"></a><strong>Ports: Full complement of digital and analog inputs and outputs</strong></h2><p> The ports are split, with some on the left side of the television as you face it, and others exiting toward the bottom.</p><p> On the left side, you’ll find a headphone jack, USB port, and two HDMI ports. The first HDMI port is also ARC capable, which means you can use it to feed audio signals to a compatible soundbar without requiring a separate audio cable.</p><p> On the bottom, you’ll find an ethernet port, digital optical output, RCA jacks for analog video and audio inputs, a coaxial connector for your antenna or cable box, and a third HDMI port.</p><p> All of the ports are well clear of the VESA mount, so you shouldn’t lose access to them if you opt to mount the set on a wall. The exception is that if you use a flush mount, you’ll have trouble reaching the down-facing bank of ports due to the way that the chassis of the television bulges out at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V97gOTfZ6Zys4aZv9gzGupbwRi8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4135681-3-b8a8cb21803f40ada92bf08de6ee6fc0.jpg"                      alt="Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 Fire TV Edition"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive"><a href="#Software-Built-in-Fire-TV-with-Alexa-voice-controls-is-snappy-and-responsive" class="headerlink" title="Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive"></a><strong>Software: Built-in Fire TV with Alexa voice controls is snappy and responsive</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the Fire TV edition of this hardware. It also comes in a slightly different configuration that’s built on the Roku platform instead, but this one has Fire TV baked in with no option to switch.</p><p> As a Fire TV, this television is excellent. It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks. If you primarily use your television for streaming through apps like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube, then you won’t have any problems with this television.</p><p> It runs just as well as our Fire TV Cube, and the menus and apps load faster than they do on our Fire TV Sticks.</p><p> We also tested out the Alexa voice command implementation and found that it works very well. Even with two other Alexa devices in earshot, including a Fire TV Cube, the Insignia’s voice remote picked up and executed our commands flawlessly.</p><p> If you watch a lot of broadcast television or have a cable box, the Fire TV interface can be a bit more frustrating. The main issue is that the Fire TV remote just isn’t built with regular television use in mind, as it lacks a numeric keypad.</p><p> You can ask Alexa to tune to specific channels, and the Fire TV interface has a section for over the air television channels, but the implementation is a little clumsy in its current incarnation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs"><a href="#Price-Right-in-line-with-other-43-inch-class-smart-TVs" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs"></a><strong>Price: Right in line with other 43-inch class smart TVs</strong></h2><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 has an MSRP of $299.99, but it’s typically available for around $249.99. Priced at around $249.99, it’s right in the general neighborhood of other 43-inch class smart televisions, including other Fire TVs, sets built around Roku, and others with proprietary systems. There are a lot of decent options in the general $200 to $250 range, but this one is the best of the bunch if you’re firmly entrenched in Amazon’s ecosystem.</p><h2 id="Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models"><a href="#Competition-Beats-out-other-Fire-TV-models" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models"></a><strong>Competition: Beats out other Fire TV models</strong></h2><p> Compared to previous 43-inch class televisions built on the Fire TV platform, the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 is the clear winner. For example, the Toshiba 43LF421U19 is a 43-inch class set that’s also built on the Fire TV platform, and sells for about $299.99, but it’s worse than the Insignia in almost every category. It isn’t 4K or HDR-capable, the viewing angles are worse, colors aren’t as good, and the built-in Fire TV is sluggish compared to the Insignia unit that we tested.</p><p> Toshiba’s 43LF621U19 Fire TV Edition is a 4K UHD television that comes closer to matching the Insignia NS-43DF710NA19, with an MSRP of $329.99, a similar set of ports, and a basic mode that doesn’t require an Amazon account. It also has worse contrast and color range, so the Insignia is still our recommendation of the two.</p><p> If you aren’t specifically focused on Fire TV, the TCL 43S517 is a decent alternative to this set. It’s a 43-inch class smart TV that’s built on the Roku platform instead of Fire TV, and it works a bit better is a regular television, with cable and over the air broadcasts, than the Insignia. It also has ever so slightly better color reproduction. It does have a higher MSRP of $499, but it’s typically available for around $240 to $260.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>This is the budget Fire TV to own if you can’t step up to a larger model.</strong></p><p> The Insignia NS-43DF710NA19 isn’t perfect, but it’s probably as close as you’ll get at this price point. This is definitely the UHD TV to own in the 43-inch class if you’re deep in the Amazon ecosystem and really want to go with Fire TV as your smart TV platform. It has great color reproduction, excellent viewing angles, and even decent sound from the onboard stereo speakers.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  NS-43DF710NA19 43” 4K Fire TV</li><li>Product Brand  Insignia</li><li>UPC  600603233920</li><li>Price  $300.00</li><li>Release Date  September 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.9 x 38.2 x 24.3 in.</li><li>Warranty  One year limited</li><li>Compatibility  Alexa, Fire TV</li><li>Platform  Fire TV</li><li>Screen Size  42.5 inches</li><li>Screen Resolution  2160p (4K)</li><li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)  Yes</li><li>Refresh Rate  60Hz</li><li>Maximum Contrast Ratio  4000:1</li><li>Ports  3x HDMI, USB, Digital Optical Audio Output, RCA Audio Output, Composite Video Input, RF Antenna Input, Headphone Jack, Ethernet</li><li>Speakers  Stereo 8-watt speakers</li><li>Connectivity Options  Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li><li>Mount Included  No</li><li>Stand Included  Yes</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/a-roadmap-to-crafting-popular-vlogging-narratives/"><u>A Roadmap to Crafting Popular Vlogging Narratives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-kitchen-solution-pros-and-cons-of-thermopro-tp67-revealed/"><u>Affordable Kitchen Solution?

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531882">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531882">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531882%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531882/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075472/7443" target="_top" id="2075472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075472/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151871/7443" target="_top" id="2151871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1542129%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1542129/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134235/18498" target="_top" id="2134235">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134235" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134235/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-top-5-budget-friendly-pinterest-video-grabs/"><u>[New] Top 5 Budget-Friendly Pinterest Video Grabs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-pinnacle-8-android-video-chat-solutions-for-big-teams/"><u>[Updated] Pinnacle 8 Android Video Chat Solutions for Big Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/"><u>Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/efficacy-analysis-of-kooteks-universal-cooling-pad-solution/"><u>Efficacy Analysis of Kootek's Universal Cooling Pad Solution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/improve-chromes-velocity-effortlessly-tips-for-a-smoother-experience/"><u>Improve Chrome's Velocity Effortlessly - Tips for a Smoother Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ng-success-the-tactics-for-increasing-youtube-audiences/"><u>Scaling Success The Tactics for Increasing YouTube Audiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-search.techidaily.com/schritt-fur-schritt-anleitung-zum-verschieben-von-iphones-kontakten-mithilfe-von-icloud/"><u>Schritt-Für-Schritt Anleitung Zum Verschieben Von iPhones Kontakten Mithilfe Von iCloud</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/taking-a-closer-look-at-samsungs-latest-entry-the-2021-galaxy-s21-and-its-implications-on-future-design/"><u>Taking a Closer Look at Samsung's Latest Entry: The 2021 Galaxy S21 and Its Implications on Future Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-garmin-forerunner/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to the Garmin Forerunner</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-improvement-handbook-revamping-your-intel-imac/"><u>The Ultimate Improvement Handbook: Revamping Your Intel iMac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-prime-day-bargains-unbeatable-discounts-on-benq-monitors-and-projectors/"><u>Top Prime Day Bargains: Unbeatable Discounts on BenQ Monitors & Projectors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-gaming-performance-with-sabrents-compact-wireless-mouse-unmatched-precision-durability/"><u>Ultimate Gaming Performance with Sabrent's Compact Wireless Mouse - Unmatched Precision, Durability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-brainpower-behind-the-beauty-tcls-32s325-roku-smart-led-tv-2019-revealed/"><u>Unveiling the Brainpower Behind the Beauty: TCL's 32S325 Roku Smart LED TV (2019) Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/windows-xpvista7-hacks-beat-non-compatible-problems/"><u>Windows XP/Vista/7 Hacks: Beat Non-Compatible Problems</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833" >camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you’re prone to losing things, this may be an issue.</p><p> The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.</p><p> The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.</p><p> The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jgQ_lVlvzgmXFPpBg5nEd6pgV_c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_12_Final_Horiz-e97c48d3af6842eb88775a9d703ce2b6.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Quality-camera-with-some-autofocus-troubles" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles</strong></h2><p> The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.</p><p> Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.</p><p> The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.</p><p> The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Bko9Uk1HIIMt9aNgtBf9ATCy0AA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_14_Final_Horiz-4f1b9fe91b8c4229b17dbbe6afb81b8c.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic"><a href="#Performance-Decent-sound-quality-for-a-small-mic" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic"></a><strong>Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic</strong></h2><p> We used both<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test the performance of the C615. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.</p><p> When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C2UBXNFmxG8nA0udy1IprMH4LBA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Logitech_C615_3LW4065141_9_Final_Horiz-1af52951f8704af9b76d7dd1ec9744a9.jpg"                      alt="Logitech C615 Webcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera"><a href="#Price-Inexpensive-HD-camera" class="headerlink" title="Price: Inexpensive HD camera"></a><strong>Price: Inexpensive HD camera</strong></h2><p> The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost.

But there’s a reason it retails so cheaply; it’s a nightmare to use, the audio quality is torturous, and the camera doesn’t approach the advertised 12 MP. Despite being nearly $60 more expensive, the C615 is the obvious winner here.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/docooler-usb-20-12-megapixel-review-4784227" >Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong><em>Genius 120-degree Webcam</em> :</strong> The Genius 120-degree Webcam is a full HD model with a wide-angle lens. Even though its actual field of view is well short of the advertised 120 degrees (in reality, it’s closer to 90), it still captures a much wider shot than the Logitech C615, giving it a clear advantage for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with large groups of people. At an MSRP of $60, the Genius is a little less expensive, too. The Logitech C615 does has a better, more flexible base than the Genius webcam however, so it’s easier to position.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/genius-widecam-f100-review-4787963" >Genius WideCam F100 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Strikes a balance between affordability and performance.</strong></p><p> The Logitech C615 Webcam strikes the perfect balance between performance and affordability.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Minecraft is the ultimate indie gaming success story, gradually transforming from a solo project into a worldwide phenomenon with more than 100 million monthly active users, spinoff games, merchandise, conventions, and so much more. But it’s not all the stuff that makes Minecraft one of the world’s most popular games—it’s the game itself.</p><p> Even a decade after its original alpha release, Minecraft remains a pure and compelling sandbox experience, dropping players into a blocky world full of seemingly endless possibilities. It has no storyline, no missions, and no obvious hooks to pull you into the game. It’s essentially a blank canvas—a blocky, pixelated blank canvas. But the beauty of Minecraft is that not only is there so much more going on beneath the surface (literally, too), but the freeform design enables new and diverse kinds of play and is especially great for younger players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KGxRcqpBaclCQ1bsvEvVp8tW4mQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-5-fe58f36987fa4b869ec30d969ff99e0a.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139120/17108" target="_top" id="2139120">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139120" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139120/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1542129%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1542129/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Plot-DIY"><a href="#Plot-DIY" class="headerlink" title="Plot: DIY"></a><strong>Plot: DIY</strong></h2><p> Believe it or not, there is no plot in Minecraft—and no storyline or fleshed-out characters, either, although the boy and girl character skins are referred to as Steve and Alex, respectively. Minecraft is a freeform playground in which to use your own imagination to create adventures and narratives. Minecraft won’t do that heavy lifting for you, although there is an increasing number of storylines found externally in official books, comics, and spin-off games.</p><p> Minecraft is a freeform playground in which to use your own imagination to create adventures and narratives.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6Lb_hrm4JI7-x9US5xPk5IZTKIo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-3-8c54d379492a429c9c74e7fd51831a90.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-on-the-surface"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-on-the-surface" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple on the surface"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple on the surface</strong></h2><p> The name of the game in Minecraft is simplicity. While there are hundreds of items to discover, craft, and use, as well as various creatures to interact with, Minecraft never complicates the way that you actually interact with each randomly-generated game world.</p><p> As a blocky hero, you’ll explore the likewise blocky world by using the analog stick on your control, keys on your keyboard, or digital directional pad on your screen—depending on which device you’re playing on. You can jump, destroy blocks and items (mine), place blocks and items, and use menus to manage your inventory and use the crafting interface. It’s not a whole lot, and while there are some other minor game mechanics that pop up along the way, it’s amazing to see a five- or six-year-old grab the controller and quickly get comfortable.</p><p> My six-year-old son has become obsessed not only with playing Minecraft and experimenting within, but also reading about the ecosystem in books and gaining ideas for his next session.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-minecraft-2363311" >Minecraft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> splits its experience into two core modes: Survival and Creative. Survival is the closest thing there is to an “adventure,” although it’s still pretty unstructured. You start with essentially nothing in Survival, which means it’s up to you to make the most of your surroundings. You’ll need to mine materials from trees and earth, build a shelter to protect yourself from the enemies that come out at night, and eventually assemble a crafting table to unlock many more possibilities. You have a wellness bar and are bound by gravity, so it’s about as close to a simulation as Minecraft gets.</p><p> Creative mode, on the other hand, removes the shackles. You have access to every single item available in the game, plus you can float through the air at will. With no life bar and no fear of peril, this is the mode for experimenting with the game’s many, many resources, as well as the mode for crafting massive, elaborate structures. Both modes offer a very different slice of Minecraft, and you might find yourself gravitating towards one or the other.</p><p> Some players will undoubtedly find Minecraft to be aimless, or even pointless. Without the kind of structure and deliberate nudges built into most other games, anyone expecting the Minecraft to do the work for them might be sorely disappointed. But for those who embrace the freeform nature of the experience, this pure sandbox affair can be deeply captivating. And the myriad nuances of the world and its creatures and items are likewise compelling. My six-year-old son has become obsessed not only with playing Minecraft and experimenting within, but also reading about the ecosystem in books and gaining ideas for his next session. It almost becomes a mindset more than just a game, but at least it’s one you can feel comfortable with.</p><p> Minecraft also has a significant multiplayer and modding component. Players can connect online to play together in both the Creative and Survival modes, or even connect to dedicated servers via the premium Minecraft Realms service. Realms charges a monthly fee, but lets you share an ongoing game world with friends far and wide. Both ways are also a great opportunity for parents and children to play together, plus the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch versions of Minecraft offer split-screen local multiplayer.</p><p> Minecraft remains such a pure and compelling sandbox experience, dropping players into a blocky world full of seemingly endless possibilities.</p><p> The PC, Xbox One, Switch, and mobile versions of Minecraft all feature a built-in Marketplace, where you can download character skins and community-made game modes. There are officially-licensed content packs based on the likes of Toy Story and Adventure Time, as well as mini-games and unique play modes to download and enjoy. Some of these features are free, while others require you to purchase in-game Minecraft Coins to access them. Sadly, the Marketplace isn’t available on PlayStation 4 due to Sony’s restrictions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KZOlKmF7mtow8s24LyCEegfMQeA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-4-4fa0600f16e3489686b18da7be164b82.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130530/26400" target="_top" id="2130530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130530/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-All-block-everything"><a href="#Graphics-All-block-everything" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: All block everything"></a><strong>Graphics: All block everything</strong></h2><p> It’s all chunky and fuzzy in Minecraft, which uses a voxel-based system that makes everything look like giant 3D pixels. Even human characters and animals are boxy-looking, but that’s part of the lo-fi charm of the game. The Minecraft look has become iconic over the last 10 years, and influenced an untold number of other games since. There are visual modifications available that smooth out the graphics or apply lifelike textures, but the core look is decidedly Minecraft.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vtgr1TMhJGVqcjBzkQXrnRqhUsY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-6-0ca6fe5018cf465caed86f1b81ef3e36.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Kid-Appropriate-They-play-it-in-schools-seriously"><a href="#Kid-Appropriate-They-play-it-in-schools-seriously" class="headerlink" title="Kid Appropriate: They play it in schools (seriously)"></a><strong>Kid Appropriate: They play it in schools (seriously)</strong></h2><p> Minecraft is rated Everyone 10+ by the ESRB. You can craft and wield weapons such as swords, axes, and a bow and arrow, and use them to slay beasts such as zombies and the explosive Creeper, as well as attack and kill animals like pigs and wolves. You can also set animals and creatures on fire. However, it’s all presented in the same kind of goofy, pixel-stylized design and isn’t graphic or realistic at all. Escaping enemies in the nighttime can be intense, however, so younger players might do better with Creative mode or by staying inside of a shelter all night in Survival mode.</p><p> Teachers have customized and designed Minecraft worlds and scenarios that help deliver interactive lessons in history, science, math, and more.</p><p> How kid-appropriate is Minecraft? Appropriate enough for Microsoft to have designed an Education Edition of the game that is used for a wide array of subjects in classrooms around the world. Teachers have customized and designed Minecraft worlds and scenarios that help deliver interactive lessons in history, science, math, and more. Yes, it’s entirely possible that your kid’s experience playing Minecraft will come in handy at school—and also likely that Minecraft can help get your kid excited about a typically-rote subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0-VNwmWbUKQwP5ADxnWHIOr9zwQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Minecraft-Playstation-4-Video-Game-2-e2c20e8d4ac643a8afd8d37093a369cd.jpg"                      alt="Minecraft"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Price-A-fantastic-deal"><a href="#Price-A-fantastic-deal" class="headerlink" title="Price: A fantastic deal"></a><strong>Price: A fantastic deal</strong></h2><p> Minecraft is an excellent value at $20 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions of the game, and just $7 for the iOS and Android editions. That’s a steal for a game that players could potentially pour hundreds or thousands of hours into. The in-game Marketplace purchases might seem a bit pricey by comparison, with some content packs and new modes selling for the equivalent of $5+ apiece, but it could be a small price to pay to help keep an already-cheap game fresh for longer.</p><h2 id="Minecraft-vs-LEGO-Worlds"><a href="#Minecraft-vs-LEGO-Worlds" class="headerlink" title="Minecraft vs. LEGO Worlds"></a><strong>Minecraft vs. LEGO Worlds</strong></h2><p> Minecraft has been described as many as modern-day or digital LEGOs although there actually are licensed LEGO Minecraft building kits out there. However, in the gaming world, LEGO tried to capitalize on the Minecraft phenomenon by making its own creative building game called<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Worlds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Released in 2017, LEGO Worlds does things a bit differently, with a hilarious narrator giving cues and little LEGO minifigure characters doling out missions. We really liked the game’s unique, LEGO-built worlds and wide array of building possibilities, however, the building controls aren’t nearly as intuitive as in Minecraft, plus it turns repetitive faster. LEGO Worlds also hasn’t caught on to nearly the same extent as Minecraft, which remains a bona fide sensation today. Chances are much better that your friends are playing Minecraft than LEGO Worlds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lego-dimensions-review-4686589" >LEGO Dimensions Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A modern classic.</strong></p><p> Even a decade after release, Minecraft is an essential gaming experience for players of all ages, and especially for younger gamers. The sandbox design means that players can drop in and concoct their own experiences in each randomly-generated world, and the way it hooks in kids via good, old-fashioned creativity and experimentation is a sight to behold. Minecraft’s open-ended design won’t be for everyone—but it’s something truly special for those who embrace it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134495/18498" target="_top" id="2134495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134495/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Minecraft</li><li>Product Brand  Microsoft</li><li>Price  $19.99</li><li>Release Date  October 2011</li><li>Platforms  Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, Windows PC, iOS, Android</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-ig-videos-building-a-powerful-focused-marketing-plan/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering IG Videos Building a Powerful, Focused Marketing Plan</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-proficiency-uncovering-the-best-5-online-title-creators/"><u>2024 Approved Exploring Proficiency Uncovering the Best 5 Online Title Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/cookiebot-driven-insights-for-advanced-web-monitoring/"><u>Cookiebot-Driven Insights for Advanced Web Monitoring</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/exploring-the-rise-of-gptbot-and-its-impact-on-site-accessibility/"><u>Exploring the Rise of GPTBot & Its Impact on Site Accessibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-copy-contacts-from-infinix-hot-30-5g-to-iphone-14-and-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Copy Contacts from Infinix Hot 30 5G to iPhone 14 and 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-apple-iphone-x-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Apple iPhone X Location without Installing Software?

It comes from a long series of Rayman games but brings an upgrade in graphics and gameplay, creating a game that not only longtime fans will be happy with, but first-time players, too. We played this game on the PS4 to further explore the game’s plot, gameplay, graphics, and sound design―and we were not disappointed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy as it should be"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy as it should be</strong></h2><p> Setup for Rayman Legends is what you would expect.

Be aware, though, that certain features of the game will not be accessible if your PS4 is not connected to the internet. Specifically, you won’t be able to access the Challenges mode, where you can play weekly challenges against other Rayman Legends players.</p><h2 id="Plot-Not-much-of-one-but-who-cares"><a href="#Plot-Not-much-of-one-but-who-cares" class="headerlink" title="Plot: Not much of one, but who cares?"></a><strong>Plot: Not much of one, but who cares?</strong></h2><p> The Rayman games have been around for years, dating back to the original, which was published in 1995. Since then, the story, characters, art, and gameplay have come a long way. In this game, you’ll choose a level―each of which is uniquely themed and has multiple maps for you to work your way through.</p><p> Rayman Legends isn’t focused on plot; it’s more interested in providing outstanding gameplay.</p><p> Once you’ve loaded into a map, you’ll come face to face with the hero’s enemy, the Magician. He’s determined to capture all the royal Teensies in the game (a small blue creature you must find and set free in each map).</p><p> You’ll chase after him, jumping from platform to platform, slaying the occasional enemy as you go. That’s about it when it comes to the plot of Rayman Legends. Sometimes the Magician will give you a specific enemy to dodge, like a giant red dragon, and at the end of certain maps, you’ll get an opportunity to catch him. But really, Rayman Legends isn’t focused on plot; it’s more interested in providing outstanding gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-Un250xgOCxgaGgFeykC6pihaaU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118212347-5c8ffe8d46e0fb0001f8d0cc.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094414/7443" target="_top" id="2094414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094414/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-What-this-is-really-about"><a href="#Gameplay-What-this-is-really-about" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: What this is really about"></a><strong>Gameplay: What this is really about</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-platform-game-812371" >2D platformer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , reminiscent of such games as Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong, but with its own history and development. Be prepared to do lots of jumping, the occasional timed run, and even a few boss fights. Thankfully, Rayman Legend is fairly forgiving when it comes to platformers. The controls are smooth, jumps are generally easy to land, and a glide feature can save you when you accidentally jump too late. Plus, a nice distribution of save points make it easy to try again if you do die.</p><p> While each level does get progressively harder as you go (indicated by the number of small skulls under the map entrance), most are achievable by the average player. There’s also the added bonus that if you are having trouble, you can force your friend to join you. When one of you dies, you’ll just turn into a bubble and your friend can free you with an attack.</p><p> This game is fairly forgiving: The controls are smooth, jumps are generally easy to land, and a glide feature can save you when you accidentally jump too late.</p><p> Teaming up for the harder levels not only makes the game a little easier, but it also makes the game more fun. You can co-op with up to four people at a time on the PS4, which combined with the casual and fun nature of the game makes it a great recommendation for best friends or for a couple who enjoys gaming together.</p><p> In the game, there are six levels, each with roughly ten maps. You’ll have to work your way through the first level to unlock the second, and so forth. Unlocks are achieved when you reach a certain number of Teensies saved―which the Magician has locked up and hidden in various places throughout each map. There is also a type of in-game currency called “Lums” that you collect as you run through each map (they look like pink or gold fireflies).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/oJz1vIp26cdVH1115RCHTapRpTE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118215643-5c8ffe7346e0fb000146adbb.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> When you’ve reached a certain number of Lums, you’ll be able to unlock new heroes, which there is no shortage of. The levels grow gradually more complex as you progress, and while we admit that most levels weren’t too difficult, a few at the end of the game will be challenging for even well-practiced players.</p><p> Beyond the basic six levels and maps, the game’s other features are also great. There is a Soccer mode, where you play on a small 2D field versus your friend; scratchers that are rewarded after certain levels, where you use the PS4’s touchpad to reveal a random reward; and a creatures page where you can view all the weird Rayman creatures you’ve collected from scratchers.</p><p> Our favorite feature is the ability to unlock levels from Rayman Origins, the game that came before Rayman Legends. It’s like you’re getting two games for the price of one.</p><p> The Challenges mode, which we mentioned earlier, is where you can attempt weekly challenges, earn rewards, and get your username on the leaderboards. The last feature―our favorite―is the ability to unlock levels from Rayman Origins, the game that came before Rayman Legends. It’s like you’re getting two games for the price of one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925544/19272" target="_top" id="1925544">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925544" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925544/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Cartoony-but-appropriate"><a href="#Graphics-Cartoony-but-appropriate" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Cartoony but appropriate"></a><strong>Graphics: Cartoony but appropriate</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends has a unique look, which is represented fairly well by its bright and eye-catching cover. It doesn’t attempt to be realistic but embraces cartoon-like graphics, with goofy characters and villains mildly reminiscent of real-life creatures. In the level titled Toad Story, you’ll come across screaming toad monsters carrying swords and shields.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ccE0U5KQNuFzIwrnVe2EtwkrG_g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118211106-5c90015f46e0fb000146adbe.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> In the Fiesta De Los Muertos level, be prepared to smash brightly colored mariachi skeletons. No matter which level, though, the art style is consistent, and while not traditionally beautiful, it’s enjoyable and fun―a perfect fit for the game.</p><h2 id="Audio-A-hidden-treasure"><a href="#Audio-A-hidden-treasure" class="headerlink" title="Audio: A hidden treasure"></a><strong>Audio: A hidden treasure</strong></h2><p> Generally speaking, the sound and music in Rayman Legends is well designed and fits with the feel of the rest of the game. But there is one thing worth mentioning when it comes to the sound and music of the game―and in our opinion, it’s the coolest thing about Rayman Legends.</p><p> At the end of each level, a special map is unlocked. This map is themed to fit with the level’s design, and each features a specific song. You’ll load in, be told to prepare yourself to run at full speed while jumping and smashing enemies, and then, as you set off, the first notes of the song begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/JIMvxIzHzgo1AXBmpTp3LxpzmTQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/RaymanLegends_20190118210656-5c9001cd46e0fb000172f0b1.jpg"                      alt="Rayman Legends"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Kelsey Simon</p><p> The beauty of these maps is how well the gameplay is designed to match the beats of the song, from how each jump will strike with the strum of a guitar, or how the smash of a drum will be timed with the slaying of an enemy. The levels might take you a few tries to finish, as they’re timed and require precision, but they’re fun enough you won’t mind doing them again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925549/19272" target="_top" id="1925549">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925549" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925549/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Very-reasonable-for-the-content"><a href="#Price-Very-reasonable-for-the-content" class="headerlink" title="Price: Very reasonable for the content"></a><strong>Price: Very reasonable for the content</strong></h2><p> Rayman Legends can be purchased for most systems at around $20.

We probably wouldn’t suggest getting Rayman Origins since much of that gameplay is included in Rayman Legends, but one could look at Rayman Adventures. If you’re looking for other fun co-op platformers, we would suggest any of the Trine games, which focus on character-swapping and puzzles more than Rayman Legends, or Nintendo’s New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe for the classic Mario experience.</p><p> Read more reviews of the best PlayStation 4 kids games available to purchase online.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Get this game.

Once you pay the upfront cost for the antenna you’re not stuck with any monthly fees for your local channels.

The picture quality is comparable to what you’d get from the cable company or streaming service—or it’s supposed to be. I tested the ultra-affordable AmazonBasics Indoor Flat TV Antenna for a week to see if its design, setup, and performance make it a viable option.</p><h2 id="Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic"><a href="#Design-It’s-all-in-the-name-basic" class="headerlink" title="Design: It’s all in the name (basic)"></a><strong>Design: It’s all in the name (basic)</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna has a slim design—it’s about as thin as card stock at approximately one-tenth of an inch in thickness. It’s constructed of sturdy plastic, with a reversible black and white side to help it fit better with your home’s decor. It’s not the most attractive antenna, and the backboards smudge and show grease and fingerprints.</p><p> It doesn’t come with a stand, but it does include 3M double-sided adhesives you can use to attach the antenna to walls or other surfaces. It also comes with a 10-foot long coax cable, which is removable. The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><p> The 10-foot coaxial cable is long enough for you to mount your antenna in high places.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557747/17382" target="_top" id="1557747">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557747" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557747/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Relatively-easy"><a href="#Setup-Relatively-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Relatively easy"></a><strong>Setup: Relatively easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the antenna is pretty straightforward. You start by plugging one end of the coaxial cable into the antenna, and then the other end to the coaxial&#x2F;antenna-in connector to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tvs-to-buy-4061107" >TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Finding the best placement for the antenna is perhaps the most difficult part, as a few inches can make a difference in your available channel selection. My test home is under a canopy of trees in a pretty rural area, and I found the best placement was on the window. Ideally, you’ll want to direct the antenna towards tower transmitters, while also doing your best to reduce obstacles (think trees, electrical interference, and walls). You’ll want to place the antenna high up as well.</p><p> Next, you change your TV to the correct input (usually TV, antenna, or Coax). Then, go to your TV’s menus and start the auto-programming process, which<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >scans for available channels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process takes a few minutes, and sometimes your TV won’t start to locate channels until about halfway through the auto-programming process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/z_YIDnD2uHBFyEpRQlkQ1HUaA_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-2-e19a3a09a82f438d8f902ded5b0fecd4.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902309/19272" target="_top" id="1902309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902309/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area"><a href="#Performance-Almost-two-dozen-channels-in-a-rural-area" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)"></a><strong>Performance: Almost two dozen channels (in a rural area)</strong></h2><p> So many things<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-improve-tv-antenna-reception-4586904" >affect an antenna’s performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —location, household electronics, tree cover, tower location, and more. The antenna displays channels of high quality. However, sometimes the channels would take a few seconds to load, and other times, I’d see a pixelated effect when I first changed the channel that would clear up after a few seconds. Once the picture was fully loaded, it was in clear high definition. The antenna is capable of displaying a clear HD picture, so I couldn’t tell the difference between the antenna’s picture and the picture from streaming services like Hulu or Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GRXmDZjwX-_X2TyOZoHytHKrjDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-3-70b77c023b7049ef985c61cf6f5064ad.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Range-35-miles"><a href="#Range-35-miles" class="headerlink" title="Range: 35 miles"></a><strong>Range: 35 miles</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics antenna has a 35-mile range, which isn’t very far considering 50 plus miles is becoming more common. It is omnidirectional, however, so you don’t need to point it in a specific direction. It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><p> Even with the short-range, I was able to pick up 16 channels on my first attempt, including The CW, PBS, and more. In a different room in my test home, I was able to get 23 channels, but this is probably because there’s less tree cover outside of the house on that side of the property. Considering the location of my test home, 23 channels is pretty good.</p><p> It supports UHF&#x2F;VHF, so I was able to get a decent selection of channels.</p><h2 id="Price-Super-affordable"><a href="#Price-Super-affordable" class="headerlink" title="Price: Super affordable"></a><strong>Price: Super affordable</strong></h2><p> The AmazonBasics Flat TV antenna sells in used condition on Amazon for only $13. In new condition, it sells for $20, which is still a great deal. However, you can find other affordable antennas for between $20 and $50 that provide a much longer range, and many offer additional features, like a longer cable. With the AmazonBasics model, you can return the unit within 30 days if it doesn’t work in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MN6DSsu9Myyo6CdrSW5MJTjHoug=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AmazonBasics-Flat-TV-Antenna-4-fd9968307cb44c9d9e824750413e0028.jpg"                      alt="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna"><a href="#AmazonBasics-Indoor-TV-Antenna-vs-Antop-AT-127-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna"></a><strong>AmazonBasics Indoor TV Antenna vs. Antop AT-127 Antenna</strong></h2><p> The Antop AT-127 (see<a class="link"   href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/ANTOP-Omni-Directional-Indoor-HD-UHF-VHF-TV-Antenna/1000503257" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a 40-mile range antenna that sells for around $35. It’s one of the better-looking antennas I’ve seen, as it’s reversible with faux light wood and dark wood sides. Unlike the AmazonBasics antenna, the Antop comes with a stand, and it has an easy-push connector for faster setup. These features go some ways towards justifying the Antop’s higher price tag.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A budget antenna that works as advertised.</strong></p><p> The AmazonBasics Antenna is a good option for anyone who wants an ultra-cheap way to get broadcast TV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885932/19272" target="_top" id="1885932">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885932" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885932/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Ultra-Thin Antenna</li><li>Product Brand  AmazonBasics</li><li>SKU  DVB-T9088</li><li>Price  $20.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.09 x 13.31 x 0.075 in.</li><li>Warranty  30 day return policy, One year limited warranty</li><li>Resolution  1080p</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Frequency  174-230 MHz</li><li>Receiving range  VHF&#x2F;UHF</li><li>Atenna version  Passive</li><li>Ports  Coax</li><li>Cable length  10-foot Coax Cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-maximizing-audio-capture-essential-techniques-for-facetime/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Maximizing Audio Capture Essential Techniques for FaceTime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-dynamic-duo-combining-multiple-photos-for-impactful-stories/"><u>[New] In 2024, Dynamic Duo Combining Multiple Photos for Impactful Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-powerdirector-pro-detailed-reviews-and-step-by-step-guides/"><u>[New] PowerDirector Pro Detailed Reviews and Step-by-Step Guides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unveil-secrets-how-to-master-video-angles-using-vlc/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unveil Secrets How to Master Video Angles Using VLC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ascend-your-earning-game-executing-a-three-part-blueprint-for-youtube-revenue-analysis/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ascend Your Earning Game Executing a Three-Part Blueprint for YouTube Revenue Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-converting-horizontals-for-igtv-tips-and-techniques-explored/"><u>2024 Approved Converting Horizontals for IGTV Tips & Techniques Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/a-deep-dive-into-the-2-in-1-features-and-elegance-of-the-new-dell-xps-13-7390-an-ultrabook-like-no-other/"><u>A Deep Dive Into the 2-in-1 Features and Elegance of the New Dell XPS 13 (7390): An Ultrabook Like No Other</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-pros-and-cons-of-idevice-power-replacements/"><u>Analyzing the Pros and Cons of iDevice Power Replacements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/detailed-blueprint-for-expert-use-of-adobe-cloud-storage-and-review-of-best-exits/"><u>Detailed Blueprint for Expert Use of Adobe Cloud Storage & Review of Best Exits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/exclusive-sneak-peek-all-upcoming-autumn-enhancements-for-apple-devices-with-emphasis-on-artificial-intelligence-features-revealed/"><u>Exclusive Sneak Peek: All Upcoming Autumn Enhancements for Apple Devices with Emphasis on Artificial Intelligence -

The antenna has a thin, flat, disc shape that is black on one side and white on the other. It is designed to be placed directly onto a flat surface, but you will probably be able to get away with a lot of different orientations depending on how close you are to the signal source.</p><h2 id="Setup-Simple-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Simple-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Simple and easy"></a><strong>Setup: Simple and easy</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna has the simplest setup of all the HDTV antennas I’ve tested. There is no mounting hardware, no power adapter, and nothing else to worry about. The antenna comes with a strip of adhesive that can be used to affix it directly to a wall or other preferred surface.</p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones.</p><p> Luckily the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna comes with a 12ft coaxial cable, so next simply attach the cable to both the antenna and your TV. Make sure to run a channel scan first for best results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983473">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983473">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983473.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983473%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983473/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Above-average"><a href="#Performance-Above-average" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Above average"></a><strong>Performance: Above average</strong></h2><p> I’ve tested a lot of similar antennas recently, and the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna had the best results of any unpowered antenna, even beating out a few of the powered ones. From my apartment, I was able to get acquire an average of 65 channels across all my tests. For reference, the worst-performing antenna found just 47, and the best, 76.</p><h2 id="Range-Fair-to-middling"><a href="#Range-Fair-to-middling" class="headerlink" title="Range: Fair to middling"></a><strong>Range: Fair to middling</strong></h2><p> Antenna’s Direct rates the ClearStream Eclipse Antenna for up to 35 miles of range, although I’ve seen reports of people getting good results from further, or having trouble from much closer. My apartment is well within the supported range, so my sentiments reflect its use in city settings more than suburbs or exurbs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/i57THpEHitQ6h-N5c-bgGLEHwJs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4078201-AntennasDirect_TVAntennas_Eclipse_04-6ea1dbbe93374539876c7e76dcebb18e.jpg"                      alt="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jonno Hill</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-for-the-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad for the performance"></a><strong>Price: Not bad for the performance</strong></h2><p> The ClearStream Eclipse Antenna lands at an MSRP of $40, putting it towards the high end of the price spectrum, especially where non-powered antennas are concerned. It did do one of the best jobs of supporting as many channels as possible, so the price is somewhat justified. Then again, every single one of the indoor antennas I’ve tested was able to handle the major network channels clearly and without issue, so a high channel number might not mean more than peace of mind in practical terms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna"><a href="#ClearStream-Eclipse-Antenna-vs-Winegard-FL5500A-FlatWave-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna"></a><strong>ClearStream Eclipse Antenna vs Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna</strong></h2><p> If my testing is any indication of broader performance, there is really no reason to get the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna instead of the ClearStream Eclipse. The Eclipse is over $10 cheaper ($40 vs $52), and managed to support 8 more channels on average. To add insult to injury, the Winegard FL5500A FlatWave Antenna is amplified using a USB power adapter, which adds a bit of clutter and complication to the overall setup.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>The best unpowered indoor antenna.</strong></p><p> The ClearStream Eclipse is one of the best options for buyers looking for a new indoor antenna. It performed better than a lot of the competition, despite being far simpler. Budget shoppers have other cheaper options to consider, but this one is perhaps the best combination of price, performance, and ease-of-use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047366/19272" target="_top" id="2047366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  ECLIPSE</li><li>Product Brand  Clearstream</li><li>Price  $40.00</li><li>Release Date  June 2016</li><li>Weight  4 oz.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  35 miles</li><li>Warranty  Lifetime parts</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-a-step-beyond-excavating-the-best-vr-treadmill-experiences/"><u>[New] A Step Beyond Excavating the Best VR Treadmill Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-driving-traffic-and-likes-a-guide-for-instagram-pros-for-2024/"><u>[New] Driving Traffic & Likes A Guide for Instagram Pros for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-enhance-photo-clarity-with-snapchats-zoom-function-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhance Photo Clarity with Snapchat's Zoom Function for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-filming-flexibility-talent-distribution-license/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Filming Flexibility Talent Distribution License</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-focus-on-the-main-sound-in-video-capturing-free-advice/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Focus on the Main Sound in Video Capturing (Free Advice)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-videopilot-hd-snapshot-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] VideoPilot HD Snapshot Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/1722903322325-expert-picks-the-top-of-the-line-htpc-devices/"><u>Expert Picks: The Top-of-the-Line HTPC Devices !</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/facebook-myths-busted-10-common-misconceptions-you-shouldnt-believe/"><u>Facebook Myths Busted: 10 Common Misconceptions You Shouldn't Believe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-samsung-galaxy-a24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On Samsung Galaxy A24 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-prophotomaster-the-ai-enhanced-editing-edge/"><u>In 2024, ProPhotoMaster The AI-Enhanced Editing Edge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/1722926982714-in-depth-analysis-of-alienwares-aurora-r7-excellence-comes-with-a-tag/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of Alienware's Aurora R7 - Excellence Comes With a Tag!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/vtech-kidizoom-duo-camera-review/"><u>VTech Kidizoom Duo Camera Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/what-you-need-to-know-before-buying-a-sim-free-cell-phone/"><u>What You Need to Know Before Buying a SIM-Free Cell Phone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Since the brand’s rebirth at the hands of HMD Global, it’s become known for phones that pack in some surprising features at a fairly affordable price point.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 exemplifies that trend, with an attractive chunky design, great screen, and a clean, stock version of Android thanks to the Android One program—all at a price that’s competitive with other mid-range handsets.</p><p> The mid-range Android market is a crowded field, so we put the Nokia 7.1 to the test around the office and at home to see how it holds up in real-world, day-to-day use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-android-smartphones-577403" >Phone Reviews &amp; Top Picks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-A-mid-range-phone-with-high-end-sensibilities"><a href="#Design-A-mid-range-phone-with-high-end-sensibilities" class="headerlink" title="Design: A mid-range phone with high-end sensibilities"></a><strong>Design: A mid-range phone with high-end sensibilities</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset that could pass for a higher-end device if you squint. It features the same general design—a glass front and back separated by an aluminum body—that we’ve seen so many times before, but it has a few design tweaks that help it stand out. The matte aluminum body features chamfered edges that add a bit of visual flair, especially when they catch the light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1cMJEwjyd7B1WxBO7uBZOm0C2So=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_3-483bfb6a868848adaaf021846b9fb559.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> The buttons are all located on the right side of the device, and they feature the same chamfered shape as the main body of the phone. The positioning of the buttons makes them easy to hit with your index finger when you hold the device in your left hand, or with your thumb if you hold it in your right.</p><p> When you turn the screen on, the first thing you notice is a chunky notch at the top. This notch is the reason that the phone is able to boast a 5.8-inch display, but it seems like a strange choice when paired with the thick “chin” at the bottom of the screen. This use of space definitely looks mid-range.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NRHkz82CaIGpj9N3UQuqHzPSBas=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_4-2c6261afee9644848e68fbf1e73c3009.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014854/22899" target="_top" id="2014854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014854/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043594/7443" target="_top" id="2043594">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043594" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043594/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Requires-updates-out-of-the-box"><a href="#Setup-Process-Requires-updates-out-of-the-box" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Requires updates out of the box"></a><strong>Setup Process: Requires updates out of the box</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Nokia 7.1 is a breeze if you have a Google account ready to go. Since it uses stock Android and is part of the Android One program, there aren’t any extra hoops to jump through. The only hiccup we experienced was the flood of required updates right out of the box—make sure you allow some extra time to download and install everything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LkCNBmkQjVwHH-SoT7i4QFOrSsk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_1-83b2f49a5f2c4443b2b7f30b502fd094.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105863/7443" target="_top" id="2105863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105863/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-a-mid-range-handset"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-a-mid-range-handset" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for a mid-range handset"></a><strong>Performance: Great for a mid-range handset</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a powerhouse, but it offers great performance compared to a lot of other mid-range handsets. It features the Snapdragon 636 processor, Adreno 509 GPU, and 4GB of RAM, which is pretty good for a mid-range device like this.</p><p> We ran PCMark’s Work 2.0 benchmark, which tests how well a phone is able to handle basic productivity tasks like web browsing, word processing, and even editing photos and videos. It received a respectable score of 6,113. That lags behind higher-end devices but compares very favorably to handsets in this price range.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 showed great strength in photo editing with a massive score of 11,093 but lagged behind in data manipulation with a score of 4,792.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset in terms of price, but it packs a lot of features that you’d expect from a much more expensive phone.</p><p> We also ran two GFXBench tests to see how the Nokia 7.1 holds up. It performed poorly on the Car Chase benchmark, only managing 5.8 fps, but it did much better on the T-Rex test, notching a much more acceptable 33 fps.</p><p> In real-world conditions, the Nokia 7.1 is snappy enough that it won’t trip you up during regular daily tasks like web browsing, email, and streaming video. It’s also powerful enough to run some games, but you’ll have to stay away from the highest graphics settings.</p><p> It’s important to note that when the Nokia 7.1 launched, it was plagued with complaints about slow operation, lag, and an unresponsive touchscreen. These appear to have been software-related issues that have since been fixed, as we experienced no such problems in our hands-on testing.</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Data-connection-is-slow"><a href="#Connectivity-Data-connection-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Data connection is slow"></a><strong>Connectivity: Data connection is slow</strong></h2><p> In our testing, the Nokia 7.1 performed exceedingly well when connected to Wi-Fi, but it had far more problems with mobile data compared to similar handsets we tested. Connected to T-Mobile’s 4G LTE network (indoors), the Nokia 7.1 achieved 4.03 Mbps down and just 0.11 Mbps up via the Ookla Speedtest app. Tested at the same time, in the same location, a Google Pixel 3 recorded 4.69 Mbps down and 1.33 Mbps up.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 exhibited similar speed issues when tested in other locations despite showing a very strong connection. The highest speeds we were able to achieve, with full reception bars, were 18.0 Mbps down and 1.42 Mbps up (compared to 37.8 Mbps down and 7.23 Mbps up measured on a Pixel 3 in the same location at the same time).</p><p> Despite these connectivity problems, we were still able to stream YouTube videos and music from Google Play over the data connection.</p><h2 id="Display-Quality-HDR-quality-with-a-chunky-notch"><a href="#Display-Quality-HDR-quality-with-a-chunky-notch" class="headerlink" title="Display Quality: HDR quality with a chunky notch"></a><strong>Display Quality: HDR quality with a chunky notch</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 has a 5.84-inch screen with a resolution of 2160 x 1090, laid out as a tall, narrow display with an aspect ratio of 19:9. It has a chunky notch at the top for the front-facing camera and pleasantly rounded edges. The viewing angles are excellent, and the screen is bright enough to see in direct sunlight.</p><p> The display makes use of Nokia’s PureDisplay technology, which means it conforms to the HDR10 industry standard. In practical terms, that means you get an HDR-quality display on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smartphones-4043781" >mid-range phone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is pretty fantastic. It’s also capable of converting standard dynamic range content to HDR, which just makes everything look nicer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z-CxaDLaus-Tzpvo30-F2j8i94o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_6-9eeeb5e2962c47e29b8a5335d69cc004.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> The only problem with the Nokia 7.1’s display is that the color temperature is extremely cool. If you hold it next to any similar phone, you’ll notice a somewhat bluish tinge. The phone does include a “night mode” feature that tints the display in increasingly strong shades of amber after the sun goes down, which can help with eye strain at night. But if you’re sensitive to blue light, you may have trouble with this display.</p><h2 id="Sound-Quality-Loud-no-distortion-but-a-lack-of-bass-response"><a href="#Sound-Quality-Loud-no-distortion-but-a-lack-of-bass-response" class="headerlink" title="Sound Quality: Loud, no distortion, but a lack of bass response"></a><strong>Sound Quality: Loud, no distortion, but a lack of bass response</strong></h2><p> At the bottom of the Nokia 7.1’s aluminum body, you’ll find the microphone, a USB-C port, and two small rectangular cutouts. That’s where the sound comes from, and despite there being two cutouts, it’s all provided by a single driver.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a powerhouse, but it offers great performance compared to a lot of other mid-range handsets.</p><p> The speaker is serviceable, and we didn’t notice too much distortion when streaming music at high volumes. There is very little bass response though, even compared to other mid-range handsets. The speaker is there if you need it, but you’ll want to plug in headphones or use an external speaker whenever possible. The Nokia 7.1 does includes a headphone jack, located on the top edge of the device, and comes with a pair of earbuds in the box.</p><h2 id="Camera-Video-Quality-Surprisingly-competent-camera"><a href="#Camera-Video-Quality-Surprisingly-competent-camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera&#x2F;Video Quality: Surprisingly competent camera"></a><strong>Camera&#x2F;Video Quality: Surprisingly competent camera</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 has two rear-facing cameras, 12 MP and 5 MP respectively. The 5 MP one is used for depth sensing to help keep your subjects in focus. The lenses are housed in a bump protrusion, outlined by the same shining metal seen on the edges of the phone.</p><p> The camera performs well in a range of lighting situations, and Nokia’s camera app provides you with a pro mode that allows you to manually control aspects like white balance and ISO.</p><p> One issue to keep in mind is that when you take a picture with the Nokia 7.1 and view it on the handset, you’re looking at an HDR-enhanced display that upscales regular photos and video with an HDR look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/VI32Dr6kjQKlJti1W9Egtq7kb10=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_2-b7780c375da34f349ba0c037120ee3ff.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/4d-M-nqoc9xpcT44HdNVobPQU1U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gs9-photo9-7b35a0c91bd544ae89dab81238efdda2.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1 rose photo"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/hepqa5K_YkbwuC1_7lRbkLgxJVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/cat-photo7-e1f061ad95324519a4cd85a39faeb1a7.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1 cat photo"                ></p><p>Lifewire</p><p> This means a photo that looks fantastic on the phone may look washed out or less clear when viewed on another device. The camera is capable of taking great snaps, but it’s important to keep that in mind. If you want your pictures to look as brilliant on your computer as they do on your phone, you’ll have to make some image adjustments after the fact.</p><p> The handset also supports the “bothie” feature that Nokia has been pushing. This feature enables you to take photos or videos with the front-facing and rear-facing cameras at the same time (if that’s something you ever felt the need to do). It also has a very competent Bokeh feature that holds your subject in sharp focus while blurring the background.</p><p> The hardware just isn’t there to challenge the best phone cameras found in flagship devices from the likes of Samsung, Apple, or Google, but the Nokia 7.1 doesn’t come with a flagship price tag either.</p><h2 id="Battery-Enough-to-last-through-the-work-day"><a href="#Battery-Enough-to-last-through-the-work-day" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Enough to last through the work day"></a><strong>Battery: Enough to last through the work day</strong></h2><p> In our testing, we found the battery life to be somewhat lacking. We subjected the Nokia 7.1 to PCMark’s Work 2.0 battery test, which is designed to simulate constant web browsing and other tasks, and the battery petered out after about seven hours.</p><p> In regular use, we found that the battery was able to stand up to a full day of phone calls, emails, and some light web browsing, video streaming, and playing music.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cD8xK_vs2o2eQxdv-D11RS_1jhE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4045957-4_5-e19cf3cd1c1f41f69279dbbcf965caf3.jpg"                      alt="Nokia 7.1"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><p> If you’re a heavier user, you may need to find a charger at some point during the day, but even lighter users would be well advised to plug in at night. You’re unlikely to get multiple days out of a single charge unless you barely use the device at all.</p><p> Charging is accomplished through USB-C, and it does support fast charging when you use the included charger and cable. Despite the glass back, wireless charging is not supported.</p><h2 id="Software-Android-One-means-guaranteed-updates"><a href="#Software-Android-One-means-guaranteed-updates" class="headerlink" title="Software: Android One means guaranteed updates"></a><strong>Software: Android One means guaranteed updates</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 ships with the Android Pie OS. It’s also an Android One phone, which means you get stock Android and not a whole lot else. In fact, Nokia’s custom camera app is the only non-standard software that you’ll find on the device when you first turn it on.</p><p> Since this handset is part of the Android One program, you can expect updates for at least 24 months from the date of release. Android One phones are also supposed to receive new operating system updates and access to new features before other phones.</p><p> With Google ending their own mid-range line of phones with the Nexus 5X and 6P, Android One devices like the Nokia 7.1 are now the best way to keep up with the newest Android features without paying a premium.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151892/7443" target="_top" id="2151892">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151892" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151892/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Solidly-mid-range"><a href="#Price-Solidly-mid-range" class="headerlink" title="Price: Solidly mid-range"></a><strong>Price: Solidly mid-range</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 is a mid-range handset in terms of price, but it packs a lot of features that you’d expect from a much more expensive phone. It retails for $349 which, in the world of ever-expanding handset price tags, almost borders on the budget category. For what you get in terms of style, specifications, and features, that’s a pretty good deal.</p><h2 id="Competition-Stacks-up-well-against-the-competition"><a href="#Competition-Stacks-up-well-against-the-competition" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Stacks up well against the competition"></a><strong>Competition: Stacks up well against the competition</strong></h2><p> The Nokia 7.1 has specs and performance that are more or less in line with flagship phones from the recent past and stacks up very favorably against contemporary mid-range phones. For example, the Motorola One retails at $399 and has a lower resolution display, a less competent camera, and an older, slower processor.</p><p> That processor, the Snapdragon 625, is even older and slower than the Snapdragon 630 found in the budget-priced Nokia 6.1. It’s also about 40 percent slower than the Nokia 7.1’s own Snapdragon 636.</p><p> The display and camera found in the Nokia 7.1 are also significantly better than those found in other handsets in this price range.</p><p> The Nokia 7.1 doesn’t compare as favorably to higher-end phones like the $549 OnePlus 6T, which blows it out of the water in both benchmark and real-world testing. But the Nokia 7.1 doesn’t come with that premium price tag, either.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Premium features and great looks, all on a budget.</strong></p><p> The Nokia 7.1 isn’t a high-end device, but it brings a lot of premium quality and features to the table. If you’re in the market for a solid mid-range handset, you won’t do much better than this.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oneplus-6t-phone-review-4589385" >OnePlus 6T <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nokia-6-1-review-4689956" >Nokia 6.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/motorola-moto-g6-review-4689366" >Motorola Moto G6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  7.1</li><li>Product Brand  Nokia</li><li>Price  $349.00</li><li>Release Date  October 2018</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.9 x 2.8 x 0.4 in.</li><li>Color  6291898</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android Pie</li><li>Processor  Qualcomm Snapdragon 636</li><li>GPU  Adreno 509</li><li>RAM  3 GB</li><li>Storage  32 GB or 64 GB</li><li>Display  5.84 inches</li><li>Camera  12 MP rear, 5 MP front-facing</li><li>Battery Capacity  3,060 mAh</li><li>Ports  USB-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li>Waterproof  No</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-revealing-the-top-10-color-enhancers-in-adobes-lightroom/"><u>[New] Revealing the Top 10 Color Enhancers in Adobe’s LightRoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/el-mejor-descargador-de-videos-4k-gratis-para-listas-de-reproduccion-descarga-rapida-y-sin-problemas/"><u>El Mejor Descargador De Vídeos 4K Gratis Para Listas De Reproducción - ¡Descarga Rápida Y Sin Problemas!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-whatsapp-messages-on-honor-90-pro-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Honor 90 Pro Without Them Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimal-strategies-for-downloading-audio-from-pinterest-videos/"><u>In 2024, Optimal Strategies for Downloading Audio From Pinterest Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/lenovo-legion-5-pro-16-installing-accurate-drivers/"><u>Lenovo Legion 5 Pro 16 - Installing Accurate Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/seeking-freedom-with-videos-which-plays-better-vlc-or-mpc/"><u>Seeking Freedom with Videos Which Plays Better, VLC or MPC?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-review-of-barnes-and-nobles-nook-glowlight-4-e-reader/"><u>The Ultimate Review of Barnes & Noble's Nook GlowLight 4 E-Reader</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-verdict-on-hisense-40h55-(u)inch(u)-5590f-smart-tv-best-budget-choice/"><u>The Ultimate Verdict on Hisense 40H55 <U>Inch</U> 5590F Smart TV - Best Budget Choice?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-key-tracking-devices-in-2er-2024-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>Top-Rated Key Tracking Devices in 2Er 2024: A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/travel-gears-new-power-bank-unicharger-pro-review-a-game-changer-in-travel-batteries/"><u>Travel Gear’s New Power Bank: UniCharger Pro Review - A Game Changer in Travel Batteries</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151858/7443" target="_top" id="2151858">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151858" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151858/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123901/26106" target="_top" id="2123901">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123901" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123901/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094428/7443" target="_top" id="2094428">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094428" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094428/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them"><a href="#Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them"></a><strong>Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them</strong></h2><p> During our testing, the Apeman C450 performed exactly as we expected. It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Netgear’s Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender (EX7300v2) hits a sweet spot when it comes to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wifi-extenders-4043312" >Wi-Fi signal extenders <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It has a wall-plug design yet hits higher speeds than some of the simpler plug-in models out there, however, it isn’t as large as some of the extenders that are nearly as sizable as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-routers-4038590" >routers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> themselves.</p><p> It also has advanced technologies such as MU-MIMO and beamforming, so it feels like a fully capable device. You’ll pay a bit more for this one compared to some of the entry-level plug-in Wi-Fi extenders, but if your home is plagued by wireless dead zones or you just want to ensure a more consistent high-speed signal throughout your dwelling, then this is a strong option. I tested the Netgear Nighthawk X4 for several days in my house for a variety of needs, including everyday work, playing online games, and streaming media.</p><h2 id="Design-Hearty-but-still-compact"><a href="#Design-Hearty-but-still-compact" class="headerlink" title="Design: Hearty, but still compact"></a><strong>Design: Hearty, but still compact</strong></h2><p> At just over 6 inches tall and 3 inches wide, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender might look a little too large to hang from a wall outlet, but most of the weight is concentrated at the base where it plugs in. It’ll only take up one plug on an outlet, leaving the other free, and it stayed securely in place during use.</p><p> Netgear opted for an angular approach here with some tapered elements, and most of the sides are covered in tiny air vents to ensure that this powerful little plug-in has the ventilation that it needs. On the front are lights that indicate the strength of the signal and show network activity, as well as power and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wps-4842308" >WPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> switch indicators.</p><p> On the left side are On&#x2F;Off and WPS connectivity buttons, as well as a switch that lets you swap between using the device as an extender (to repeat an existing Wi-Fi signal) or an access point, which would create a wireless network from a plugged-in Ethernet cable from your modem. That<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-port-817546" >Ethernet port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is on the bottom of the device, and when in the typical extender mode, you can use it to plug in a wired device to access the wireless network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ahWiBPBlk75slmsmgc-c4cnSgf8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_03-6a6cab81b4ec4da39c89aa3a92cb1f16.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 (EX7300) Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-setup-awkward-app"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-setup-awkward-app" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple setup, awkward app"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple setup, awkward app</strong></h2><p> Setting up the Netgear Nighthawk X4 essentially means capturing the signal from your Wi-Fi router and then finding an ideal spot to place the extender to bring Wi-Fi into dead zones and areas with an inconsistent signal.</p><p> There are three ways to do this. Starting with the extender plugged in near your router, you can set it up by following the prompts in Netgear’s Nighthawk mobile app for iOS or Android, by doing the same via a web interface on your computer, or by using the WPS button on both the extender and router. The last option is the simplest, as the devices can automatically pair via a button found on the extender and basically any modern router.</p><p> While the setup process is straightforward, the Nighthawk mobile app itself was a bit wonky.</p><p> I set mine up using the iOS app, and while the process is straightforward, the Nighthawk app itself was a bit wonky. I had to try connecting to the router’s setup network several times before it went through, and it just seemed inconsistently responsive throughout. Ultimately, however, I was able to finish the setup process.</p><p> Once that is complete, you can unplug the extender and find a new place for it in your home. Netgear advises placing it about halfway between your router and the dead zone(s) that you’re trying to address, but you may need to play around with positioning based on the design of your home and potential obstructions that could weaken the signal. If you’re not getting the signal boost that you expect, then try another plug location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/rfn4cAzCyxeBXmoIx0VVBH7R0w8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_04-188447741dad41d7a4c51fd7c71861f2.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135395/19272" target="_top" id="2135395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135395/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Connectivity-Steady-stellar-speeds"><a href="#Connectivity-Steady-stellar-speeds" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Steady, stellar speeds"></a><strong>Connectivity: Steady, stellar speeds</strong></h2><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X4 worked as advertised, delivering strong speeds, improving upon the signal available from the router in the further corners of my house, and even holding a 5GHz signal pretty well when a fair distance away from the extender. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mimo-wifi-routers-818332" >MU-MIMO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multiple user, multi-in multi-out) design allows for more simultaneous signals while beamforming helps hone a signal towards its requesting device. All told, these technological advancements seem to help deliver strong wireless performance.</p><p> Even though I paired it with a TP-Link router, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 maintained the same network names as my router uses. My smartphone and laptop automatically switched to the stronger signal when plugged in. Beyond the speed difference, I could tell when I plugged in the extender and saw the 5GHz network jump from a steady 2 bars to a full 4 bars once the extender was fully powered on.</p><p> Typically, 2.4GHz networks are slower but offer wider range, while the faster 5GHz networks don’t stretch quite as far. Luckily, the extender helps negate the latter issue and can give you more of that 5GHz speed in more places of your home. In my case, a speed test in my office with the extender in place revealed a download speed of 89Mbps with the 2.4GHz network, but then 203Mbps on the 5GHz network.</p><p> Technological advancements such as MU-MIMO and beamforming seem to help deliver strong wireless performance.</p><p> Distance testing revealed that the 5GHz network continued to provide strong speeds even approximately 75 feet away from the extender. Testing in my extended backyard with just one wall between my laptop and the extender, I saw download speeds of 38Mbps at 25 feet, 27Mbps at 50 feet, and 16Mbps at 75 feet on 2.4GHz. However, the 5GHz network gave me 132Mbps at 25 feet, 81Mbps at 50 feet, and 75Mbps at 75 feet.</p><p> Online gaming was also smooth across the board with the Netgear Nighthawk X4. I saw a typical ping of around 38 with both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz extended networks in Rocket League, and a couple points faster when plugged into the Ethernet port. I played several matches across the configuration options and encountered no sluggishness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ugGkkd4SJutt9ZSqg6hsgakNAAU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Netgear_NetWorkExtenders_NighthawkX4_05-8a00f82288884d71bd867f253500e04f.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006928/19272" target="_top" id="2006928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Worth-the-investment"><a href="#Price-Worth-the-investment" class="headerlink" title="Price: Worth the investment"></a><strong>Price: Worth the investment</strong></h2><p> At an MSRP of $150 but often seen now for $130, the Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender costs a fair bit more than a simpler entry-level extender, but the strong performance—especially on the 5GHz band—makes it a worthy investment if you plan on playing online games or streaming extensive media. There are much cheaper Wi-Fi extenders out there, however (like the one below), if your needs aren’t very extensive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123738/7443" target="_top" id="2123738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Netgear-Nighthawk-X4-vs-TP-Link-RE200"><a href="#Netgear-Nighthawk-X4-vs-TP-Link-RE200" class="headerlink" title="Netgear Nighthawk X4 vs. TP-Link RE200"></a><strong>Netgear Nighthawk X4 vs. TP-Link RE200</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/tp-link-re200wi-fi-range-extender-review-4846136" >TP-Link’s RE200 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (view at<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/42300087" >Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is similar in its plug-in approach, but it’s much smaller and costs a fraction of the price at $30. It also gave me solid connectivity on 2.4GHz, although the 5GHz performance left something to be desired.</p><p> The other annoyance was the fact that it creates separate wireless networks for the extender if you don’t have one of the recent, compatible TP-Link routers. That can cause headaches with needing to switch between networks based on where you are in your home. On the other hand, it’s $30. If you just want to push your Wi-Fi into an additional room or two for web browsing and Netflix, then don’t feel obligated to spend $100+ on an extender.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A strong mid-range Wi-Fi extender.</strong></p><p> The Netgear Nighthawk X4 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender finds a pretty ideal middle ground in the Wi-Fi extender market, delivering a strong performance that’s better than what you’ll likely get from a cheap, entry-level extender. Better yet, it’s not as pricey as some of the higher-end devices out there. If you don’t want to commit to a full mesh network upgrade to your home and just want a strong, reliable extender to complement an existing Wi-Fi router, then this is the extender to buy.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Nighthawk X4 AC2200 Wi-Fi Mesh Extender (EX7300)</li><li>Product Brand  Netgear</li><li>SKU  EX7300v2</li><li>Price  $149.99</li><li>Product Dimensions  6.3 x 3.2 x 1.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 year</li><li>Ports  1x Ethernet</li><li>Waterproof  N&#x2F;A</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-aerial-artistry-in-motion-examining-gopro-karma-performance/"><u>2024 Approved Aerial Artistry in Motion Examining GoPro Karma Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-video-stock-sites/"><u>Best Budget-Friendly Video Stock Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/effortless-pairing-of-airpods-to-your-quest-3-headset-how-to-avoid-disturbing-others-during-setup/"><u>Effortless Pairing of AirPods to Your Quest 3 Headset | How To Avoid Disturbing Others During Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/embellishing-windows-tray-adding-number-lock-symbols/"><u>Embellishing Windows Tray: Adding Number Lock Symbols</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-does-the-stardust-trade-cost-in-pokemon-go-on-honor-100-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How does the stardust trade cost In pokemon go On Honor 100 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/iphone-13-analysis-in-depth-performance-and-feature-evaluation/"><u>IPhone 13 Analysis: In-Depth Performance & Feature Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/is-the-apple-watch-series-6-a-notable-advancement/"><u>Is the Apple Watch Series 6 a Notable Advancement?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/lc-41-whisperer-buzzing-in-your-ears-for-20/"><u>LC-41 Whisperer: Buzzing in Your Ears for $20</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-the-new-era-in-commuting-with-mods-simplistic-sidecar-e-bike-design/"><u>Mastering the New Era in Commuting with Mod's Simplistic Sidecar E-Bike Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/nickelodeon-unveils-new-show-at-prestigious-american-kids-event/"><u>Nickelodeon Unveils New Show at Prestigious American Kids’ Event</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/why-waiting-is-not-an-option-upgrade-to-ios-153-for-optimal-iphone-functionality/"><u>Why Waiting Is Not an Option: Upgrade to iOS 15.3 for Optimal iPhone Functionality</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Though Sony panels are sometimes on the expensive end of the spectrum, there are some older Sony 4K TVs that can be had for a nice little discount. One such TV is Sony’s XBR65X850F from their X850F series. This specific model has now been replaced by the X850G, but that doesn’t mean you necessarily need to go with the most current model. In fact, snagging one of these earlier generation sets can save you some cash without forcing you to compromise too much.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139113/17108" target="_top" id="2139113">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139113" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139113/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Standard-Sony"><a href="#Design-Standard-Sony" class="headerlink" title="Design: Standard Sony"></a><strong>Design: Standard Sony</strong></h2><p> The XBR65X850F’s design is a combination of sleek and workmanlike. The stand on this Sony is pretty common for TVs these days, with two V-shaped feet that stick out to either side. While they look aluminum, these are actually plastic too, with merely an aluminum finish. They are decently steady, but we noticed a bit of wobble if you move the TV around. It should be plenty sturdy for most, though you will need a fairly wide stand for them to rest on since they stick out so far. There’s also no room for adjusting the unit up or down, but they’re tall enough to fit a soundbar underneath if you want. They also flip open on the top if you want to use them for some clever cable management.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/v7wi7isxu06LAoWNZK3dJ908mCk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-4-cb1a370bd78244b383c802010a570313.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><p> The rear panel is entirely matte black plastic. It’s pretty basic, but you also won’t be staring at the back of your TV a whole lot either. On the left you’ll find the power cable all by its lonesome, with the rest of the inputs and ports on the right. These are split between a hub facing the right side of the unit, and another cluster that stick straight out the back. This might be annoying if you want to get the TV super close to a wall, but the main ports most people will be using are found on the right side anyway.</p><p> If you really hate the stand you’re in luck, because also found on the back here is a VESA compatible mount for placing the TV on a wall. The XBR65X850F uses a VESA 300x300 mount, so make sure you get the right size.</p><p> On the front of the screen, the bezels are a little thicker than some of the 4K TVs we’ve reviewed, but they’re pretty thin and shouldn’t distract.</p><p> Sadly, it seems like a lot of manufacturers are minimizing controls on the TVs themselves, including Sony. Sony’s opted to use the same three-button layout found on all their current units, which work fine in a pinch, but are annoying as heck if you actually need to use them for anything other than powering the TV on or off.</p><p> The included remote is pretty standard for all Sony TVs, which means it’s big and packed with functionality. You can quickly set favorites with the hotkeys, access settings, change inputs, perform basic functions, and even manually enter channel numbers. We quite prefer this type of remote to something like a minimal Apple TV remote with only a sliver of the features. You’ve also got quick access to<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> right on the remote to perform some basic functions.</p><p> On the front of the screen, the bezels are a little thicker than some of the 4K TVs we’ve reviewed, but they’re pretty thin and shouldn’t distract. There’s your standard anti-glare coating found on the screen here too.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Stick-to-the-on-screen-instructions"><a href="#Setup-Process-Stick-to-the-on-screen-instructions" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Stick to the on-screen instructions"></a><strong>Setup Process: Stick to the on-screen instructions</strong></h2><p> Setting up pretty much any modern-day smart TV is an easy process, so just stick to the on-screen instructions and you’ll be golden. Go ahead and unpack it all, tear off that plastic film, plug in the power cable, and turn on the device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vvIZMf3BNAr8JmiDAVdv4o3ceHg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-2-7eabd63fb6c0415ab75fd927d664a841.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><p> Sony has done a solid job here of making the setup process simple, or maybe we should be thanking Google for that, as this is an Android TV. All you need to do is follow along with the on-screen instructions and complete them as necessary. Using the remote, you’ll be prompted to choose a language, location, internet connection, sign into accounts, etc. Just stick to the guide.</p><p> With the initial process done, you will likely need to run a quick update check. This should automatically pop up, but check under the settings tab if it doesn’t. An update to the firmware should improve things considerably, especially if you need to upgrade to the latest version of Android TV. Updating takes a bit of time to do, so maybe go watch some TV while…oh right. Well, whatever you do during this process, just remember not to unplug the power while it’s running through updates.</p><h2 id="Image-Quality-Impressive-4K-for-IPS-with-some-shortcomings"><a href="#Image-Quality-Impressive-4K-for-IPS-with-some-shortcomings" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Impressive 4K for IPS with some shortcomings"></a><strong>Image Quality: Impressive 4K for IPS with some shortcomings</strong></h2><p> This section is perhaps the most important for a TV, and while the XBR65X850F performs pretty well in some aspects here, it also has a few weak points.</p><p> Starting off with some of this unit’s strengths, this particular series uses an IPS panel for the screen, which means you’re going to get vibrant colors, a nice backlight for viewing in bright rooms, and excellent viewing angles. This all adds up to a superb experience if you’ve got a big living room that’s brightly lit by windows, where viewers might not be able to sit completely centered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/r5reh9LkA7QvieX1JzBg5J8qNjY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-5-00a73edbf91c48c6aa2718ab211f2e5d.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918719/19272" target="_top" id="1918719">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918719" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918719/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><p> However, IPS panels are notoriously bad for black uniformity and backlight bleed, which can cause clouding around the edges. We found this to be the case on our XBR65X850F, and while not unusable, it’s probably not the best option for viewing in dark environments because of this. The TV does have solid gray uniformity however, with no dirty screen effect. This is a huge boon if you’re a big sports fan.</p><p> Contrast is a bit disappointing. With a native contrast ratio of 894:1, the X850F series performs poorly in dark scenes, even worse when watching in a dark room.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-hdr-and-4k-4176961" >HDR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an area where the XBR65X850F gets decent marks, but isn’t implemented quite as well as on as newer Sony TVs with brighter screens. The HDR palette here is just average, and while most people should find it adequate, it’s far from best in class.</p><p> For color calibration, it’s not great right out of the box, but this can be adjusted considerably if you’re willing to spend some time tweaking the settings. The best thing to do is to look up a calibration guide online for your specific model. We always recommend this to maximize your viewing experience. Color gamut is slightly above average in this series as well, so while some super saturated scenes might not be perfect, they’re pretty close.</p><p> Lastly, let’s take a look at motion blur and response times for the XBR65X850F. This particular Sony does very well in this area thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. While watching some fast-paced action scenes and playing games in 4K, we didn’t notice any real ghosting or stutters. This means your content should be nice and buttery smooth. However, there isn’t an option for variable refresh tech like FreeSync here, so the TV won’t be the best for gaming (though it is perfectly fine for this, bolstered by that high refresh rate). Response time here is another strength, as the XBR65X850F is very fast in this department.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vRvHMYGCPPg8nNrLBKdXwLPfwzg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sony-XBR65X850F-4K-TV-3-9f0e77e7fa1d4533877316afb591cc71.jpg"                      alt="Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Loud-but-distorted"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Loud-but-distorted" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Loud, but distorted"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Loud, but distorted</strong></h2><p> Built-in speakers are never going to be great, but they’re nice to have if you’re lacking an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/connect-tv-to-external-audio-system-1846816" >external sound system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like a soundbar. While we’d recommend getting an external setup for the best experience, let’s take a quick look at what the XBR65X850F has to offer with the included setup.</p><p> Right off the bat, this TV can get quite loud and you shouldn’t run into any volume issues. That being said, the overall experience is mediocre at best. The louder you turn it up, the more distortion is added. These speakers should suffice in quiet environments if you’re primarily looking for nice clear dialogue with treble and mid, but the bass is not so good.</p><h2 id="Software-A-bit-sluggish-but-good-enough"><a href="#Software-A-bit-sluggish-but-good-enough" class="headerlink" title="Software: A bit sluggish but good enough"></a><strong>Software: A bit sluggish but good enough</strong></h2><p> Android TV has come a long way since its debut, but not all TVs are getting timely updates, and these lower-end Sony TVs are notoriously slow for this. While some TVs are already running Android TV 9.0, many are stuck with older versions.</p><p> The overall experience with our XBR65X850F wasn’t awful, but it’s far from perfect. For starters, the UI is pretty hectic, with lots of content being shoved in your face. Thankfully this variant is ad-free, so no worries there (unlike<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216" >Roku <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> Despite the somewhat crowded interface, you do have an amazing amount of apps, games and other content since this is connected to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-play-1616720" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This is perhaps the biggest strength of the software, as well as the interconnectivity with your Google account. You’ve also got handy access to Google Assistant. The assistant can provide you with info on the fly or even perform some basic functions. It isn’t something you’ll use all the time, but it works very well and is nice to have included.</p><p> This series uses an IPS panel for the screen, which means you’re going to get vibrant colors, a nice backlight for viewing in bright rooms, and excellent viewing angles.</p><p> Browsing through the interface, we did find it to be a bit laggy and choppy at times, which can be quite frustrating. Hopefully, this can be fixed down the line when new versions of Android TV make their way to the device.</p><p> One last thing, your phone can also be used as a remote if you so choose. All you need to do is download the app and connect it to the TV. This works with both Android and iOS devices (thanks Google). While it’s not a good as the regular remote, it works fine enough if you’re too lazy to get up and find the standard remote.</p><h2 id="Price-Not-bad-for-the-size-but-not-the-cheapest"><a href="#Price-Not-bad-for-the-size-but-not-the-cheapest" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not bad for the size, but not the cheapest"></a><strong>Price: Not bad for the size, but not the cheapest</strong></h2><p> The X850F series come in a range of sizes, from 65 to 85 inches, so the prices can vary considerably depending on which one you go with. Any TV in this size range is going to cost a good bit of coin, no matter the manufacturer, but Sony isn’t too bad here.</p><p> On Sony’s website, the 65-inch model we tested here is listed at $1,300, the 75 at $2,300, and the 85 at a whopping $4,000. Now these prices aren’t exactly accurate, especially since these are an older series. Typically you can find the 65-inch for about $1,100 or so. The other models are also heavily discounted depending on where you look, so definitely shop around. It’s likely that you can snag them for even less during sales.</p><p> But how do these prices stack up against comparable TVs from competitors like LG or Samsung? Taking a quick look around online, you can easily save a few hundred dollars by going with a comparable LG TV, while Samsung was pretty closely matched with Sony. In the end, the price for the X850F series isn’t the best bang for your buck, but it ain’t bad either.</p><h2 id="Sony-XBR65X850F-vs-Samsung-UN65RU8000"><a href="#Sony-XBR65X850F-vs-Samsung-UN65RU8000" class="headerlink" title="Sony XBR65X850F vs. Samsung UN65RU8000"></a><strong>Sony XBR65X850F vs. Samsung UN65RU8000</strong></h2><p> Now there are a ton of comparable 4K TVs out there stacked up against the Sony XBR65X850F, but Samsung is a similarly reputable brand, so let’s compare their UN65RU8000 (view on<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN65RU8000-Ultimate-SurgePro-6-Outlet/dp/B07Q6VCCLF?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4796693%7Cn899f0376278d4881a5af76b596b54aa000%7C" >Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> Alright, so each of these are 65-inch 4K TVs with similar specs, but the biggest difference is that the Sony is IPS, and the Samsung VA. What this boils down to (in a basic explanation) is that the Samsung will be a much better option for dark environments, while the Sony will excel in bright rooms. The Sony will also be a better choice if your viewing arrangement is wide and off-center.</p><p> If you’re a gamer, however, the Samsung will really shine. This is due to the inclusion of FreeSync, which allows for variable refresh rates and more consistent FPS without tearing or artifacting. In addition, it also performs better in terms of input lag and response time. The UN65RU8000 also has better blacks and a higher contrast ratio.</p><p> The prices are pretty close here, with a slight edge going to Samsung, but that may change depending on where you shop. We’d recommend the Samsung hands down for anyone looking to game on their TV, but the Sony for those with wide, spread out, bright rooms.</p><p> Still undecided? Check out our guide to the best Sony TVs.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A solid IPS panel 4K TV.</strong></p><p> The X850F series is far from perfect, but the Sony XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV and its family are more than capable of providing a pleasurable viewing experience for most people. Despite this, there are probably better options out there that can be had for even less.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  XBR65X850F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV</li><li>Product Brand  Sony</li><li>Price  $1,300.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.125 x 35.5 x 12.5 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Android TV</li><li>Screen Size  65 in.</li><li>Screen Resolution  3840 x 2160</li><li>Ports  3 USB, 1 Digital Optical Audio Out, 1 Analog Audio Out 3.5mm, 1 Component In (shared), 1 Composite In (shared), 1 Tuner (Cable&#x2F;Ant), 1 Ethernet, 1 IR In</li><li>Speakers  2 full range, 2ch</li><li>Connectivity Options  4 HDMI</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-achieving-distraction-free-video-conferencing-with-skype/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Achieving Distraction-Free Video Conferencing with Skype</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-pristine-movie-trailer-curated-list/"><u>[Updated] Pristine Movie Trailer Curated List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/avoiding-career-pitfalls-in-graphic-artistry/"><u>Avoiding Career Pitfalls in Graphic Artistry</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-tecno-spark-20-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Tecno Spark 20? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-honor-90-gt-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Honor 90 GT Phone Pattern Lock without Factory Reset</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/smart-family-connectivity-elite-parental-control-routers-to-watch/"><u>Smart Family Connectivity: Elite Parental Control Routers to Watch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/streamlined-experience-with-the-tp-link-deco-p9-wireless-router-analysis/"><u>Streamlined Experience with the TP-Link Deco P9 Wireless Router Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-clever-engineering-behind-twelve-souths-bookbook-v2-an-essential-review-for-macbook-guardians/"><u>The Clever Engineering Behind Twelve South's BookBook V2: An Essential Review for MacBook Guardians</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-complete-guide-to-amazfit-helio-rings-cost-release-date-and-detailed-features/"><u>The Complete Guide to Amazfit Helio Ring's Cost, Release Date, and Detailed Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-impact-of-apples-m1-on-imac-benchmarking-power-and-visual-clarity/"><u>The Impact of Apple's M1 on iMac: Benchmarking Power and Visual Clarity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/1726029213837-tiktok/"><u>TikTok 動画直接下載及錄音的最基本方法 - 超簡単！</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Even in the realm of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-lightweight-laptops-to-buy-4065134" >lightweight, ultraportable laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the LG Gram 15.6-inch(15Z980) feels like a bit of an anomaly. It’s a larger, wider notebook given the 15.6-inch display, but at just 2.4 pounds it is shockingly light. It’s a flyweight in a category ruled by featherweights, and while it doesn’t have quite the dense, durable-feeling form of some competitors, the lightness sure sets it apart.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike. But does LG’s laptop (2018 model reviewed) really stack up to the likes of the Apple MacBook Air and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 in terms of value and overall experience? Read on to see what we thought.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/radDS_2IRuzjTlZxUS5og2a3PIM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Top_04-b051e3660efc406ab97f92df654d3762.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing"><a href="#Design-Amazingly-light-but-not-wholly-convincing" class="headerlink" title="Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing"></a><strong>Design: Amazingly light, but not wholly convincing</strong></h2><p> Weight aside, the LG Gram 15.6-inch doesn’t make the strongest impression in the category. It’s a relatively minimal design that’s not too fussed-over, but doesn’t give the impression that it was chiseled out of a solid brick of aluminum like a MacBook Air or Pro. In fact, it’s made from nano carbon magnesium, which must be how LG kept it so darn light.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >MacBook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or Surface Laptop. It’s incredibly thin metal all around the exterior, to the extent to which a firm press on any surface just gives a little too much to feel comfortable. Likewise, the screen hinge isn’t nearly as secure as other laptops we’ve tested in this category. Our tested version didn’t come with the optional touch display, but we imagine it would be tricky to use with this much give to the display hinge.</p><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant.</p><p> In any case, that’s the trade-off for the incredible lightness, which really is amazing. The LG Gram 15.6-inch is only about one-third of a pound lighter than the MacBook Air, yet with that weight spread across a wider surface, the difference feels even more significant. This is an easy laptop to cart around or pop into a messenger bag—although it is quite wide at 14.1 inches. That’s the nature of the beast with a larger screen, but just make sure that you have a bag that can handle it.</p><p> When it comes to ports, the LG Gram 15.6-inch leaves little behind. It’s decked out. On the left side, you’ll find a USB 3.0 port, USB-C port, and an HDMI port, along with the port for the included power cable—although you can also charge via USB-C. Look over on the right side and you’ll find two more USB 3.0 ports, a headphone jack, and even a microSD slot. Compared to those aforementioned Apple and Microsoft laptops that stick with one or two USB or USB-C ports, the LG Gram comes across as incredibly generous.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in ‘—‘ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days.</p><p> Getting our hands on the keyboard, some frustrations quickly emerged. Given the wide 15.6-inch display, LG had a lot of space to work with for the keyboard, and so it added in a full keypad to the right of the QWERTY keyboard. The problem here is twofold: some of the most-used keys, like backspace, are smaller than on many other keyboards. And to complicate matters, the keypad is scrunched right up against the keyboard without a break.</p><p> Right out of the gate, we were consistently typing in “—“ when we tried to hit backspace, and the problem continued for days. Eventually, we started learning from the harsh experience of having to essentially double-delete characters, so it’s likely that you’ll get used to the keyboard’s quirks. Typing on the keys feels great, at least: they’re soft and quiet, and enabled speedy input when not fighting those odd layout issues. On balance, it’s very usable and responsive, but still tries to cram too many keys into the available space. The trackpad, meanwhile, works fine but definitely feels a bit small on that wide body—Apple’s extra-large trackpads are spoiling us.</p><p> The entry-level model we reviewed comes with a meaty 256GB solid state drive (SSD), which is double the SSD storage we typically see in a base model laptop. While 128GB might be cutting it close for some users, the boosted tally provides plenty more space for game downloads and storing local media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1qu1WvdEgTzjUQ8QH_Lssx79xF0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Trackpad_05-f0d9dc63b03e4650a92e30747090889a.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144281/7443" target="_top" id="2144281">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144281" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144281/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions"><a href="#Setup-Process-Just-follow-the-directions" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Just follow the directions"></a><strong>Setup Process: Just follow the directions</strong></h2><p> There’s little reason to worry about getting the LG Gram 15.6-inch laptop up and running quickly. It has Windows 10 pre-installed, so you’ll simply follow the onscreen prompts to enter your Wi-Fi info, check for updates, select a few options, and ultimately find yourself ready to roll on the desktop. It shouldn’t take more than a handful of minutes.</p><h2 id="Display-Large-and-capable-enough"><a href="#Display-Large-and-capable-enough" class="headerlink" title="Display: Large and capable enough"></a><strong>Display: Large and capable enough</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram’s 15.6-inch screen is good, but not great. It’s certainly large: the widescreen panel stretches out longer than the 13-inch screens seen on a lot of ultraportable computers, and the extra real estate is absolutely noticeable. It gives you enough extra space to comfortably multitask, such as having a web browser and a document side-by-side, or a Slack window in full view to distract you from whatever you’re supposed to be doing for work.</p><p> Pair that with the large screen, fantastic battery life, and loads of ports, and you have a computer that’s built for productivity and portability alike.</p><p> The downside is that this 1920x1080 IPS LCS panel isn’t nearly as high-resolution as some of its rivals, such as the MacBook Air (2560x1600) and Surface Laptop 2 (2256x1504)—both of which also benefit from squeezing their pixels into smaller respective frames. The LG Gram just doesn’t have the pin-sharp allure of those screens, plus it looks dimmer and doesn’t come across as vibrant as a result. It’s solid, and 1080p can certainly get the job done, but there are much better-looking screens in this category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TFbt9G36hk5JyrBL8cIdIuYQ66E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Keyboard_03-fd7e355ac5944f12a8107746d0afbf24.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118315/7443" target="_top" id="2118315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118315/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks"><a href="#Performance-Solid-power-for-everyday-tasks" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks"></a><strong>Performance: Solid power for everyday tasks</strong></h2><p> With an 8th-gen Intel Core i5-8250U at 1.6Ghz and 8GB RAM onboard, the 2018 LG Gram runs on the same chipset as the Surface Laptop 2 and Dell XPS 13. It provides solid power for everyday tasks, and we didn’t run into any noticeable slowdown while moving around Windows 10, surfing the web, typing up documents, and loading up apps. It’s not a powerhouse CPU, however, and creative professionals looking for a machine for photo or video editing, for example, will surely want more processing power and RAM to play with.</p><p> In benchmark testing, the Cinebench score of 1,173 was higher than the 1,017 we registered on the entry-level Surface Laptop 2 (and higher is better), and the 975 seen on the 4K screen-equipped Dell XPS. The PCMark 10 score was higher, as well, with 3,085 on the LG Gram and just 2,112 on the Surface Laptop 2.</p><p> LG assures us that its Gram line has passed several military-grade durability tests, and we have no reason to doubt them—but to the touch, the laptop just doesn’t feel as strong as a MacBook or Surface Laptop.</p><p> With an integrated Intel Graphics UHD 620 GPU inside, the LG Gram isn’t built for intense gaming needs. However, it does OK with modern 3D games at low-to-medium settings. As has been the case with other laptops we’ve tried, battle royale shooter smash Fortnite defaulted to settings that looked nice but led to a very choppy frame rate in action, and we ultimately had to turn off all effects and hit low settings on nearly everything to make the game run smoothly. Switching to Rocket League, the car-soccer game ran decently with mid-to-high settings, but again we trimmed down a few settings for a speedier frame rate.</p><p> As an aside, while the LG Gram often runs near-silently, there are extended periods of time in which there’s an audible hum coming from the back. It’s not the typical, very loud fan noise that pops up while gaming or heavy multitasking from some computers, but it can be a bit grating. We noticed it while charging the computer, but also while running on the battery—with no consistency on that front. It’s a mild annoyance, but it’s one we noticed whenever it emerged.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-It-makes-an-impression"><a href="#Audio-It-makes-an-impression" class="headerlink" title="Audio: It makes an impression"></a><strong>Audio: It makes an impression</strong></h2><p> You won’t see the speakers when the LG Gram is standing up as normal, but you’ll hear them loud and clear. The stereo speakers are tucked underneath the laptop at the left and right edges near where your wrists rest, and thanks to the slight elevation from the rubbery feet on the bottom of the laptop, they’re given enough space for the output to shine. Audio playback sounds robust and clear—not quite to the level of Apple’s current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, but very close. We were pleased with it.</p><h2 id="Network-Connects-as-expected"><a href="#Network-Connects-as-expected" class="headerlink" title="Network: Connects as expected"></a><strong>Network: Connects as expected</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram had no problem connecting to a few different networks, including a home Wi-Fi network, the Google Wi-Fi network at Starbucks, and a mobile hotspot. The connection always seemed speedy and downloads ran at a steady clip. Testing it on a home Wi-Fi network during peak evening hours, we saw a download speed of about 30Mbps and an upload speed of 13Mbps. We tested the network on an iPhone XS Max immediately after and saw comparable speeds there, as well. You can connect to both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks with ease.</p><p> Interestingly, the LG Gram also has an Ethernet-to-USB-C dongle included in the box. That’ll be handy if the Wi-Fi is on the fritz, or you’re at a hotel or conference center that somehow doesn’t have Wi-Fi in the year 2019.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AhDZOG33ttJ8LfKQnzvHO7K-S8I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram_Closed_02-d40445064b4945729278aeae3d8ae1c0.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915870/19272" target="_top" id="1915870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915870/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="Battery-Seriously-amazing"><a href="#Battery-Seriously-amazing" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Seriously amazing"></a><strong>Battery: Seriously amazing</strong></h2><p> The battery is undoubtedly one of the key highlights of the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) experience. This massive 72Wh cell is estimated to provide upwards of 19 hours of uptime, according to LG—but as is usually the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , that estimate isn’t reflective of typical use cases. Even so, with max brightness, the fact that we could get about half that amount still makes for a long-lasting experience.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100 percent brightness. That means it’s built for a full-on workday, which makes it a great option for productivity. In our video rundown test, in which we constantly stream a Netflix movie at 100 percent brightness, the LG Gram 15.6-inch lasted for 9 hours, 14 minutes. With locally-stored video, you’re sure to get a whole lot more out of it.</p><p> With our typical workflow of browsing the web, chatting on Slack, typing up documents, and streaming a little bit of media, we typically saw 8-9 hours of uptime at 100% brightness.</p><h2 id="Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello"><a href="#Software-Hello-Windows-but-no-Windows-Hello" class="headerlink" title="Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)"></a><strong>Software: Hello, Windows (but no Windows Hello)</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch comes with Windows 10 Home preinstalled, and if you’ve used Windows over the years, then you should be pretty comfortable here. Windows 10 has lightly evolved the PC operating system with feature enhancements and tweaks without losing the classic, familiar DNA within, and it’s the OS of choice for computer gaming and apps of all shapes and sizes. It’s easy to use and understand, and runs well with the Intel Core i5 and an SSD onboard.</p><p> Unfortunately, this entry-level model of the LG Gram 15.6-inch isn’t able to take advantage of Windows Hello biometric security, as the camera above the display doesn’t have the needed sensors for scanning your face. We missed the near-instantaneous facial recognition of the Surface Laptop 2, and having to type in a PIN number each time we opened up the lid. Pricier models of the laptop offer a fingerprint scanner, however.</p><h2 id="Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths"><a href="#Price-Solidly-priced-considering-its-strengths" class="headerlink" title="Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths"></a><strong>Price: Solidly priced, considering its strengths</strong></h2><p> Originally priced at $1,249, the entry-level LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) can now be found for about $999 as of this writing. LG has rolled out newer 2019 versions that look identical and have the same core features, but upgrade to the latest generation of Intel Core processors. You should see a little bit more speed in benchmark testing, although it’s unclear whether there’s any noticeable difference during regular usage.</p><p> In any case, $999 is a more appealing value for a computer that doesn’t pack as much polish as some rivals, but wins out when it comes to elements like battery life, screen size, and minimal weight. For some users, that’s sure to be an appealing combination. Note that you can spend quite a bit on upgrades with the LG Gram 15.6-inch, including opting for versions with a faster Intel Core i7 processor, additional RAM, a fingerprint sensor, and even a touch display if desired.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5yzhAkphyYfWOMofqawuktHJlA0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-Gram-v.-Surface-comparison-4946178bf2e94230820d2b19d2fb7197.jpg"                      alt="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><h2 id="LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own"><a href="#LG-Gram-15-6-inch-2018-vs-Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-2-Better-than-Microsoft’s-own" class="headerlink" title="LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?"></a><strong>LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop 2: Better than Microsoft’s own?</strong></h2><p> The LG Gram 15.6-inch and Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 are similarly equipped, in terms of having the same processor and integrated graphics chip, although they vary quite a bit from there. As noted, the LG Gram’s claim to fame comes with the resilient battery and large screen for such a lightweight computer.</p><p> The Surface Laptop 2 can’t match those specs, but it goes for a higher-end feel between the more durable-feeling design, the Alcantara material finish around the keyboard, Windows Hello camera support, and the higher-resolution touch display. All told, the Surface Laptop 2 is a more appealing device, but the LG Gram’s long-lasting capabilities make it a workhorse option for those who don’t care as much about bells and whistles.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Well-built for productivity.</strong></p><p> There are better all-around ultraportable laptops in this price range, and we had some issues with the feeling of the build, the keyboard layout, and the merely good display quality. However, if you’re in the market for an incredibly light laptop with a big screen and a battery that lasts and lasts, it’s hard to ignore the LG Gram 15.6-inch (2018). You get a very capable computer for the price, and it’s a notebook that can legitimately last through a full workday even at max brightness.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Gram 15.6-inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>UPC  15Z980-U.AAS5U1 &#x2F; 719192618947</li><li>Price  $947.77</li><li>Release Date  December 2017</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.4 x 10.7 x 2.4 in.</li><li>Warranty  1 year</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  1.6Ghz quad-core Intel Core i5 8250U</li><li>RAM  8GB</li><li>Storage  256GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  72 Wh</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C, 3x USB-3, HDMI, microSD, 3.5mm headphone port</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-flair-up-your-stories-and-feeds-instagrams-simplified-method-of-sharing-gifs/"><u>[Updated] Flair Up Your Stories & Feeds Instagram's Simplified Method of Sharing GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-youtube-comment-management-turn-it-on-or-off/"><u>2024 Approved YouTube Comment Management Turn It On or Off</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/exclusive-prime-day-offers-save-big-on-iphones-and-macbooks/"><u>Exclusive Prime Day Offers: Save Big on iPhones & MacBooks!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/expert-strategies-for-fbx-gameplay-capture-for-2024/"><u>Expert Strategies for FBX Gameplay Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-apple-iphone-13-to-factory-settings-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Reset Apple iPhone 13 to Factory Settings? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-sound-on-your-airpods-when-connected-to-pc-windows-1110/"><u>How to Restore Sound on Your AirPods when Connected to PC (Windows 11/10)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-swagtron-swagger-electric-scooter-unveiled-combining-fashion-forward-design-with-efficient-travel/"><u>The Swagtron Swagger Electric Scooter Unveiled: Combining Fashion-Forward Design with Efficient Travel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-rated-rotibox-heated-hat-and-bluetooth-earpiece-combo-for-ultimate-convenience/"><u>Top Rated Rotibox Heated Hat and Bluetooth Earpiece Combo for Ultimate Convenience!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-practical-side-of-the-acer-xfa240-in-our-latest-evaluation/"><u>Unveiling the Practical Side of the Acer XFA240 in Our Latest Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/upgrade-your-3d-printing-process-save-time-and-money-with-the-149-elegoo-dip-n-cure-system/"><u>Upgrade Your 3D Printing Process: Save Time & Money With the $149 Elegoo Dip-N-Cure System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/worldwide-standard-moco-keyboard-with-unfolding-design-wireless-bluetooth-functionality/"><u>Worldwide Standard MOCO Keyboard with Unfolding Design, Wireless Bluetooth Functionality</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a fairly barebones unpowered antenna that utilizes the same paper-thin rectangular design that can be found on some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market. This design comes with its share of pros (easy setup, not too much clutter) and cons (limited performance, can’t stand on its own).</p><p> Mohu might not be breaking new ground with this antenna, but it’s more than sufficient for most city dwellers and perhaps even a few buyers in the suburbs with a relatively unobstructed path to the broadcast source.</p><h2 id="Design-Basic-but-effective"><a href="#Design-Basic-but-effective" class="headerlink" title="Design: Basic but effective"></a><strong>Design: Basic but effective</strong></h2><p> You can find a dozen identical versions of this unpowered antenna by doing a quick search for TV antennas online, and not for no reason. It’s a very uncomplicated design, doesn’t take up too much space, and doesn’t have a lot of points of failure. The 9x11.5-inch rectangular antenna surface is thin, pliable, and features two small punch-holes towards the top which can be used to pin the antenna to an appropriate surface.</p><p> The matte surface is white on one side and black on the other, which could be useful for helping blend the device in with your surroundings. The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is neither the thickest or the thinnest version of this design that we’ve seen. Some are closer to paper thin and extremely flexible, and others were more rigid. If you need to be able to bend the antenna quite a bit to fit it where you need to, this might not be the right one for you.</p><h2 id="Setup-Dead-simple"><a href="#Setup-Dead-simple" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Dead simple"></a><strong>Setup: Dead simple</strong></h2><p> Setup of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is as easy as it gets with antennas. Since there is no external power to connect, you only need to worry about connecting the included coaxial cable to the device and to your TV and using the included pins or adhesive tabs to affix the device to a surface. Ease of setup is one of the benefits of a non-amplified antenna such as the Mohu Leaf.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible"><a href="#Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Acceptable but not incredible"></a><strong>Performance: Acceptable but not incredible</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna wasn’t the highest performing antenna that I tested, even among similar unpowered antennas. In my channel acquisition test, the Leaf picked up 56 channels on average across all the iterations performed.</p><p> My apartment is located within city limits and doesn’t provide too much of a challenge for antennas, but I was able to reliably get as many as 76 channels from other devices. Nonetheless, the Leaf still provided a clear picture of all the major network stations without any issue. The only channels that I couldn’t pick up with the Leaf were pretty obscure, such as an audio-only station from a Korean Christian church. I think I’ll be okay without that one.</p><h2 id="Range-Fairly-limited"><a href="#Range-Fairly-limited" class="headerlink" title="Range: Fairly limited"></a><strong>Range: Fairly limited</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is rated, as its name implies, for up to 30 miles of range. This is about what I would expect from an unpowered antenna. This device is clearly designed for buyers who live within close proximity to their local TV broadcast source, and not for those further out into the suburbs and beyond.</p><h2 id="Price-Excellent-for-the-performance"><a href="#Price-Excellent-for-the-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Excellent for the performance"></a><strong>Price: Excellent for the performance</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna has a 90-day rolling average price of $29 on Amazon, which puts it on the more affordable end of the spectrum. The price definitely feels appropriate for the performance and feature set, but it’s not an all-out bargain.</p><p> Buyers probably wouldn’t be wise to spend more money unless they live a bit further from their signal source and have had trouble with similar antennas in the past. I think that for most people living in cities, the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna should be more than enough.</p><h2 id="Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna"><a href="#Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna"></a><strong>Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Mohu also makes the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mohu-blade-tv-antenna-review-4843106" >Mohu Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a powered antenna with a slightly more unique design for a minor premium of $40. This antenna managed to reliably acquire an average of 69 channels in my tests, a big leap from the performance of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna. That having been said, the Blade does require a power source, and installation is slightly more cumbersome than that of the Leaf. If I wasn’t having any trouble getting the channels I watch with the Leaf, I probably wouldn’t upgrade to the Blade personally.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>No fuss, good value.</strong><br> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a great entry point into the TV antenna space, providing a nice mix of performance and value in a dead-simple package that won’t burden buyers during setup. It might not be powerful enough to suit the needs of suburban users and beyond, but if you’re close enough to the signal source, it’s a nice option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Leaf 30</li><li>Product Brand  Mohu</li><li>Price  $32.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2011</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.5 x 11.7 x 1.5 in.</li><li>Color  White</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  30 miles</li><li>Warranty  One year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-transformative-tips-on-crafting-engaging-cover-art/"><u>[New] Transformative Tips on Crafting Engaging Cover Art</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-maximize-focus-with-enhanced-zoom-on-google-meet/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Maximize Focus with Enhanced Zoom on Google Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/access-luxury-free-access-to-your-dreamset-of-50-banners/"><u>Easy-Access Luxury - Free Access to Your Dreamset of 50 Banners!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/free-secure-video-calls-top-10-safe-apps-for-android-and-ios-users/"><u>Free, Secure Video Calls Top 10 Safe Apps for Android and iOS Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-leave-a-life360-group-on-oppo-a18-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Leave a Life360 Group On Oppo A18 Without Anyone Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-stream-ready-steam-gameplay-filming-guide/"><u>In 2024, Stream-Ready Steam Gameplay Filming Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/in-depth-review-philips-hf3505s-impact-on-natural-waking-routines/"><u>In-Depth Review: Philips HF3505's Impact on Natural Waking Routines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/insightful-overview-how-does-google-voice-calling-compare-to-traditional-methods/"><u>Insightful Overview: How Does Google Voice Calling Compare to Traditional Methods?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/insightful-review-on-google-pixel-5-the-harmony-of-cost-effective-performance-and-high-end-benefits/"><u>Insightful Review on Google Pixel 5: The Harmony of Cost-Effective Performance and High-End Benefits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/interactive-experience-with-philips-49-ultra-hd-curved-led-display-perfect-for-gamers/"><u>Interactive Experience with Philips' 49 Ultra HD Curved LED Display - Perfect for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-home-connectivity-with-tp-links-deco-p9-mesh-wi-fi-system-reviewed/"><u>Mastering Home Connectivity with TP-Link's Deco P9 Mesh Wi-Fi System Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-using-ez-grabber-with-this-tutorial-for-2024/"><u>Mastering the Art of Using EZ Grabber with This Tutorial for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/maximizing-your-network-coverage-with-netgear-ex3700-ac750-wi-fi-range-extender-a-complete-guide-and-evaluation/"><u>Maximizing Your Network Coverage with Netgear EX3700 (AC750) Wi-Fi Range Extender: A Complete Guide and Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/nixplay-original-w15a-review/"><u>Nixplay Original W15A Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/photo-your-desktop-windows-edition-for-2024/"><u>Photo Your Desktop Windows Edition for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Consider These</h2><p> The world of DVRs has changed since the debut of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cost-of-tivo-1130924" >TiVo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you don’t own a TiVo, you’ll likely end up using one of the DVRs supplied by your cable company. However, if you’re interested in buying a DVR, here are some questions to ask yourself before spending your hard-earned cash.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Am-I-Willing-to-Spend"><a href="#How-Much-Am-I-Willing-to-Spend" class="headerlink" title="How Much Am I Willing to Spend?"></a>How Much Am I Willing to Spend?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vGt5VvBsFKDr7ygkp5Wt6zid8u4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/set-top-dvr-1130767-f2aa7f11e3d2442b966d53b8aa2d25fd.png"                      alt="Illustration of a person sitting atop a DVR unit, holding binoculars to their eyes"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Miguel Co</p><p> Set-top DVRs range in price from about $40 to upwards of $400, and you’re looking for a BlueRay DVR you could pay as much as $2500. The prices climb as the hours of recording increase. Other set-top DVRs vary in price depending on the size of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152" >hard drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the larger the drive, the more hours you can record) and whether or not the device records to DVD. Some have VCRs built-in as well.</p><p> It’s essential to have a budget set for your DVR so that you can quickly determine which companies to compare when you set out to choose one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075476/7443" target="_top" id="2075476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-I-Want-to-Use-a-DVR"><a href="#How-Do-I-Want-to-Use-a-DVR" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Want to Use a DVR?"></a>How Do I Want to Use a DVR?</h2><p> Do you want to record lots of TV shows, watch them, and then delete them?

A few provide DVR service for free.</p><p> These DVRs are leased and remain the property of the cable or satellite provider. The advantage in this is that there is no upfront cost for these DVRs; the device is part of your monthly bill.

If your TV hasHDMI, that’s your best option. After HDMI, S-Video or component inputs are preferable over composite (RCA) inputs.</p><p> If you have a surround sound setup, connect<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/digital-optical-connection-1846881" >digital optical <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or coaxial audio instead of composite audio. You will get ​a much better picture and sound with higher quality connections.</p><p> Deciding on a set-top DVR isn’t easy, but sometimes the decision is made for you. If you subscribe to cable or satellite, it makes sense to use their DVRs. However, if you want more recording time or DVD recording capability, then go with TiVo or a combination DVD and hard drive recorder.</p><p> It’s best to read about the various set-top DVRs and decide what’s best for you.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-infusing-personality-with-custom-fonts-in-ae-workflows/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Infusing Personality with Custom Fonts in AE Workflows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-getting-acquainted-with-youtube-tvs-distinctive-features/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Getting Acquainted with YouTube TV's Distinctive Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-scene-selection-mastery-livestreams/"><u>[Updated] Scene Selection Mastery Livestreams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/amp-up-your-cars-vision-with-five-headlight-mods/"><u>Amp up Your Car's Vision with Five Headlight Mods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/chuckle-inducing-digital-artistry-mobile-edition-for-2024/"><u>Chuckle-Inducing Digital Artistry (Mobile Edition) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/complete-ipad-showdown-find-your-perfect-tablet/"><u>Complete iPad Showdown: Find Your Perfect Tablet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722974735141-get-the-newest-intel-wi-fi-6-ax200-drivers-compatible-with-windows-10-and-11-free-download/"><u>Get the Newest Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200 Drivers - Compatible with Windows 10 & 11, Free Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-essential-meme-blueprints/"><u>In 2024, 10 Essential Meme Blueprints</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-mastering-youtube-video-edits-the-ultimate-step-by-step-guide/"><u>In 2024, Mastering YouTube Video Edits The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-vivo-x100-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Vivo X100? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/nokia-71-a-detailed-review-of-its-crystal-clear-screen-and-impressive-camera-features-at-a-great-value/"><u>Nokia 7.1: A Detailed Review of Its Crystal Clear Screen and Impressive Camera Features at a Great Value</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/review-of-overcooked-2-savory-madness-unleashed/"><u>Review of Overcooked! 2: Savory Madness Unleashed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-review-how-does-amazonbasicss-12-sheet-high-security-shredder-stack-up/"><u>The Ultimate Review: How Does AmazonBasics's 12-Sheet High Security Shredder Stack Up?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unboxing-and-testing-why-nintendo-switch-leads-in-mobile-play/"><u>Unboxing and Testing: Why Nintendo Switch Leads in Mobile Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-sonys-dsc-w800-quality-meets-affordability/"><u>Unveiling Sony's DSC-W800 - Quality Meets Affordability</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR sound card was a great card in 2013. In 2019, however, the ZxR has started to lag behind the competition. It provides pretty clear audio, but it requires two PCIe slots and costs $250 MSRP. Compare this to products from other audio card manufacturers, such as ASUS and EVGA, which been able to provide better audio performance for as little as $160. That said, the Sound Blaster ZxR isn’t without merits: it has a lot of inputs and outputs, extensive EQ software, and still produces quality sound. It also has features gamers need, such as treble boost and voice isolation, and it accommodates 6.3mm auxiliary input and output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U_vmwZDe5HbbungQ5L2hzf2LVto=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-4-b0d1cca56ec04a61b83e20d1cecf2aea.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-convenient"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-convenient" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and convenient"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and convenient</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR features a black and red chassis on its main and daughter boards, brightly accented in gold around the transistors and back plate. Together, the cards have enough outputs to natively support a 5.1 surround sound speaker system. They have 2 RCA outputs, 2 3.5mm outputs, two RCA inputs, one optical TOSLINK input, one optical TOSLINK output, one 6.3mm microphone input, and one 6.3 headphone output jack. The ZxR also comes with an Audio Control Module (ACM), which is Creative Labs’ take on an amplifier and on extending the 6.3mm connections. It has both 3.5mm and 6.3mm inputs and outputs so you can choose where you’d like to plug in your headphones and microphone. On the ACM’s face lies a big, plastic volume knob that controls the headphones’ loudness.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Some-odd-decisions"><a href="#Hardware-Some-odd-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Hardware: Some odd decisions"></a><strong>Hardware: Some odd decisions</strong></h2><p> For users who may own higher impedance headphones, the amplifier can comfortably drive headphones with up to a 600 ohm impedance. Unfortunately, the volume control on the ACM works passively by altering the output impedance, which can distort audio on headphones with high inductance like the Sennheiser HD800 (see “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-output-impedance-4690092" >How Low Should Output Impedance Be? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ”). A better and only slightly more costly solution for Creative Labs would have been to have the knob control the ZxR’s in-built volume control rather than try to do it passively. The HD800 sounded fine when plugged directly into the sound card and using the system volume control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1t84P8oe4qch2aJ6lknx0lwunWw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-2-de43d07bd3db40a282f55347c8956c9a.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123729/7443" target="_top" id="2123729">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123729" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123729/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934292/19272" target="_top" id="1934292">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934292" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934292/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup"><a href="#Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup"></a><strong>Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup</strong></h2><p> To install the hardware, we popped open our mid-size PC tower and inserted the sound card and daughter board into two available PCIe slots. Creative Labs had the foresight to build the main card with a PCIe 1x slots, giving the user flexibility in where they connect their cards to the motherboard. Once the cards were secured, we plugged the headphones and microphone into the corresponding jacks.</p><p> It’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP.</p><p> Unfortunately, configuring Creative Labs’ drivers and software suite was a much less intuitive process. The ZxR’s outputs are controlled via the Sound Blaster Z-series Software, where users can select whether they’re listening with their headphones or their speakers, apply EQ effects, and more. By default, the software is set to output to speakers with several different EQ effects turned on. We had to manually switch it to headphone output and turn off EQ; the software does not automatically detect which jacks are in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6uorHzKoJdW1FBv0B5ZfeoE8XzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-3-17de2156e4294b5c85f151bd0cd97aa4.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Excellent-sound"><a href="#Audio-Excellent-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Excellent sound"></a><strong>Audio: Excellent sound</strong></h2><p> Once the EQ effects are turned off, the Sound Blaster ZxR provides beautiful sound. While it wasn’t quite as clean or crisp as an enthusiast audiophile amplifier, such as the OPPO HA-1, it was solid for a system that costs a quarter of the HA-1’s price. On the HD-800s, the bass came across slightly muddy, but the ZxR provides solid quality for consumer-grade headphones like the Sennheiser GSP300 or the Sony MDR-7506. As our our<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/headphones-buying-guide-4172763" >headphone buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggests, most headphones under $250 will not be sensitive enough to meaningfully distinguish between the ZxR and the HA-1.</p><p> Should you happen to own dynamic headphones, you should find their impedance curve. Dynamic headphones with a high impedance may be distorted by the ACM, thanks to the ACM’s high resistance. How your headphones will be affected depends on their impedance curve: for the HD800s, for example, there is a peak at 100Hz (this range captures electric bass and the lower octaves of guitars), so the upper bass range is boosted relative to the other frequencies in the audio. Increasing the volume on the ACM reduces its output resistance and in turn reduces the distortion, but it may be easier to plug equipment directly into the sound card and use the system volume instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1CZw4BSxxTqlBF1kxT0_rl73XCU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-5-e1022e9adc854517af98407c4be32691.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options with mixed utility"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options with mixed utility</strong></h2><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package. Here, you can EQ any frequency between 20 and 20,000 Hz or activate “Crystallization,” “Scout Mode,” and “Theater Mode.” Crystallization adds punch to the audio’s treble, making voices stand out against the background. Theater Mode is similar to Crystallization, but it tries to_only_ boost voices instead of the entire treble range. We found it great for watching videos. Meanwhile, Scout Mode is squarely aimed at gamers. It theoretically makes enemy noises like footsteps louder.</p><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package.</p><p> When testing Scout Mode in_Overwatch_ , we did not find the adjustment helpful; Scout Mode made our enemies’ and our allies’ movements louder, making it harder to tell where the enemy was coming from. Without adjustments,<em>Overwatch’s</em> audio already makes the enemies’ movements louder than your allies’, making Scout Mode not only ineffective but an active detriment to gameplay. Other games that strongly rely on situational awareness have also likely invested the time into making enemies’ movements noticeable. Overall the software modifications Sound Blaster provides are situationally useful but not the comprehensive range of options we’d like to see at this price point.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Unjustified-expense"><a href="#Price-Unjustified-expense" class="headerlink" title="Price: Unjustified expense"></a><strong>Price: Unjustified expense</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR retails for about $250, on par with other high-end consumer audio cards. Its 6.3mm audio and microphone jacks, coupled with support for headphone impedance of up to 600 ohms, gives the listener flexibility in the rest of their audio setup: no need for 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapters or extension cords. One major hardware disappointment is its lack of 7.1 surround compatibility, which is something many sound card enthusiasts prize in a high-end sound card. There are also a number of other products with better sound quality for less than the ZxR’s $250 MSRP.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short of less expensive options"></a><strong>Competition:</strong> <strong>Falls short of less expensive options</strong></h2><p> As we’ve already emphasized, it’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP. You can find a number of sound cards for significantly less that provide competitive performance, though they generally don’t offer the same robust software package as the ZxR.</p><p> For a fraction of the price ($99 MSRP), you could get your hands on the Schitt Audio Fulla, an external DAC&#x2F;AMP set that covers 16 to 300 ohm headphones with plenty of power and has a clean, no-nonsense design.

The ZxR sounds good, and gamers will not be disappointed by the ZxR’s power, but audio purists and 7.1 surround fans can find cleaner performance with fewer bells and whistles for the $250 asking price of the ZxR. It’s a card that hasn’t aged well since it’s 2013 release, and one that’s been largely overshadowed by some of its competitors in the interim.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-z-review-4769764" >Sound Blaster Z <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-audigy-rx-review-4769814" >Sound Blaster Audigy RX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Sound Blaster ZxR</li><li>Product Brand  Creative</li><li>UPC  Model Number SB1510</li><li>Price  $250.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2013</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.6 x 4.1 x 7.9 in.</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Main Card)  6.3mm Headphone Out, 2x 3.5mm Out, 2x RCA Out, 6.3mm Microphone In</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Daughterboard)  2x 3.5mm RCA In, Optical TOSLINK In, Optical TOSLINK Out</li><li>Audio Interface  PCI Express</li><li>Frequency Response  100Hz to 20kHz (microphone); 10Hz to 45kHz (headphones)</li><li>Output Signal-to-Noise Ratio  124 dB</li><li>Headphone Amplifier  16-600 ohms</li><li>Chipset  Sound Core 3D</li><li>Digital-to-Analog Converters  Burr-Brown PCM1794 and PCM1798</li><li>Headphone Op-Amps (Swappable)  New Japan Radio NJM2114D</li><li>Headphone Driver  Texas Instruments TPA6120A2</li><li>Line Out Op-Amps (Swappable)  Texas Instruments LME49710</li><li>Capacitors  Nichicon</li><li>Software  Sound Blaster Z-Series Software</li><li>What’s Included  Sound Blaster ZxR sound card, Sound Blaster DBpro card, Sound Blaster Audio Control Module, 1Optical Cable, 1x Stereo(3.5mm)-to-RCA cable, 1x DBpro cable, Quick Start Leaflet, Installation CD containing: Drivers for Windows 7 and Windows 8, Creative Software Suite, User’s Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-peering-into-the-future-lg-tv-bp550-2023-review/"><u>[Updated] Peering Into the Future LG TV BP550 2023 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/affordable-dawn-experience-totobays-second-gen-wake-up-light-reviewed-for-early-risers-seeking-value/"><u>Affordable Dawn Experience: Totobay's Second Gen Wake-Up Light Reviewed for Early Risers Seeking Value</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/best-of-the-best-top-external-bd-drives-reviewed-for-202e/"><u>Best of the Best - Top External BD Drives Reviewed for 202E</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/brand-new-dbpower-peak-pro-review-reliability-durability-and-value-for-price/"><u>Brand New DBPOWER Peak Pro Review – Reliability, Durability & Value for Price</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-smartphone-showdown-why-the-samsung-galaxy-a20-still-stands-out/"><u>Budget Smartphone Showdown: Why the Samsung Galaxy A20 Still Stands Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/correcting-graphics-glitches-on-new-windows-11/"><u>Correcting Graphics Glitches on New Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/from-noisy-to-neat-cutting-out-clutter-on-photos-for-2024/"><u>From Noisy to Neat Cutting Out Clutter on Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-unleashing-storytelling-potential-making-youtube-trailers-in-filmora/"><u>In 2024, Unleashing Storytelling Potential Making YouTube Trailers in Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/resolving-the-red-screen-error-on-your-windows-11-pc/"><u>Resolving the Red Screen Error on Your Windows 11 PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/unblocking-a-restricted-boot-drive-solutions-for-windows-10-users/"><u>Unblocking a Restricted Boot Drive: Solutions for Windows 10 Users</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Most of the ports are positioned on the rear, with the exception of the second USB port that sits along the side next to the Wi-Fi button. Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes Setup is simple, and you can use the Tether app or the TP-Link site. There’s a QR code in the quick setup leaflet, so you can easily find the app. As it goes with most routers, you’ll find a temporary network name, password, and login info on the label. The app walks you through the setup process step-by-step, guiding you through creating your 2.4 and 5 GHz networks. Connectivity: Decent speeds, long range The Archer C9 AC1900 is an 801.11ac router. It can reach up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and up to 600 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band for a total of 1900 Mbps. The C9 has beamforming, which promotes a more concentrated signal and a longer range. It has four separate gigabit LAN ports for hardwiring devices. In my test home, my ISP speeds are 500 Mbps. On the 5 GHz band, my laptop’s Wi-Fi speed clocked in at 290 Mbps when sitting in the same room as the router. In the back corner of my office, which is often a dead zone, my laptop clocked 66 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. As I traveled far away from the router, I was able to maintain a signal, but the speed slowed down quite a bit. In the backyard, another area where I often experience drop offs, the speed came in at 39 Mbps. I repeated the Ookla speed test numerous times, and the results remained around the same in each room. I was able to get slightly higher speeds on an iPhone 11, but overall the router performed extremely well at close proximity, but not so well at a distance. Key features: Guest network and parental controls The C9 has two USB ports (one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0), so you can share printers or storage over the network. Although this is somewhat of a basic router, it has some modern perks. It supports the most recent Internet Protocol version, IPv6. You can also create a guest network, so you don’t have to share your main network credentials with visitors. The C9 does feature parental controls, but they aren’t exactly comprehensive. Software: TP-Link Tether app You can control the router’s functions from the companion app, Tether. In the app, you can do things like set parental time limits on devices, create a guest network, block devices from the network, and perform basic network maintenance. I also recently tested the TP-Link Archer AX6000, which uses the Tether app as well. The app interface changes based on which router you’re using. With the Archer AX6000, I had more options visible because it’s a more feature-rich unit. I was impressed with the app’s ability to remove those features from the interface with the C9, instead of leaving them in place for me to click on and get that “not available with this model” message. The TP-Link site gives you access to more advanced features, like USB settings for file and printer sharing, more advanced parental controls (blocking sites), access control, DHCP settings, and forwarding and security features. Price: A budget router The Archer C9 AC1900 is an older model, so it’s not as readily available as it was a couple of years back. You can typically find it for around $120, which is a good price for a long range router with its feature set. TP-Link Archer C9 AC1900 vs. ASUS RT-AC1900 The ASUS RT-AC1900 typically sells for closer to $150, but you can find it refurbished or on sale for around the same price as the Archer AC1900. The two routers look similar at first glance—they both have three very long antennas protruding from the top. They have similar specifications, including a dual-core processor, AC1900 speed, and dual-bands, and a long range. But, the ASUS RT-AC1900 offers a few perks, like TrendMicro security and NVIDIA GameStream technology."                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148638/16836" target="_top" id="2148638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148638/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Takes-less-than-10-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Takes-less-than-10-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes"></a><strong>Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes</strong></h2><p> Setup is simple, and you can use the Tether app or the TP-Link site.

I was able to get slightly higher speeds on an iPhone 11, but overall the router performed extremely well at close proximity, but not so well at a distance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gPQRxhQBJ13ETuiP-7-Vy9eGcss=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TPLink_LongRangeRouters_ArcherAC1900_05-4ddd14a5299f45279789011ce3b9e8ea.jpg"                      alt="TP-Link Archer C9 AC1900"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Key-features-Guest-network-and-parental-controls"><a href="#Key-features-Guest-network-and-parental-controls" class="headerlink" title="Key features: Guest network and parental controls"></a><strong>Key features: Guest network and parental controls</strong></h2><p> The C9 has two USB ports (one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0), so you can share printers or storage over the network.</p><p> You can create a guest network, so you don’t have to share your main network credentials with visitors.</p><p> Although this is somewhat of a basic router, it has some modern perks.

It doesn’t include Alexa control or MU-MIMO technology, but it’s supposed to provide a long signal range for larger homes, as well as support fast enough speeds for online gaming and 4K media. I tested the TP-Link AC1900 alongside several other long range routers to see how well it performs in the real world. Design: Fingerprints galore The Archer AC1900 definitely isn’t the most attractive router I’ve seen. The version I tested is black, but TP-Link also makes the C9 in white. The gloss finish gives the AC1900 a cheap look, and it unfortunately shows each and every smudge and fingerprint when you touch the surface. The indicator lights sit on the front face, and you can easily see the network status with a quick glance. The C9 has a slate grey plastic border, which goes around the top perimeter, angles outward, and serves as a stand for the router. The stand allows you to position the AC1900 horizontally or vertically. However, you’ll have to move your cabling under the stand to place the router in a horizontal position, so you can’t easily move it between the two orientations without disconnecting your cables. The Archer C9 has three removable antennas you can swivel and adjust. Although they’re a necessary evil, the antennas are extremely long (almost six inches), so the router looks oddly tall when in the vertical position with the antennas extended. Most of the ports are positioned on the rear, with the exception of the second USB port that sits along the side next to the Wi-Fi button. Setup: Takes less than 10 minutes Setup is simple, and you can use the Tether app or the TP-Link site. There’s a QR code in the quick setup leaflet, so you can easily find the app. As it goes with most routers, you’ll find a temporary network name, password, and login info on the label. The app walks you through the setup process step-by-step, guiding you through creating your 2.4 and 5 GHz networks. Connectivity: Decent speeds, long range The Archer C9 AC1900 is an 801.11ac router. It can reach up to 1300 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and up to 600 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band for a total of 1900 Mbps. The C9 has beamforming, which promotes a more concentrated signal and a longer range. It has four separate gigabit LAN ports for hardwiring devices. In my test home, my ISP speeds are 500 Mbps. On the 5 GHz band, my laptop’s Wi-Fi speed clocked in at 290 Mbps when sitting in the same room as the router. In the back corner of my office, which is often a dead zone, my laptop clocked 66 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. As I traveled far away from the router, I was able to maintain a signal, but the speed slowed down quite a bit. In the backyard, another area where I often experience drop offs, the speed came in at 39 Mbps. I repeated the Ookla speed test numerous times, and the results remained around the same in each room. I was able to get slightly higher speeds on an iPhone 11, but overall the router performed extremely well at close proximity, but not so well at a distance. Key features: Guest network and parental controls The C9 has two USB ports (one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0), so you can share printers or storage over the network. Although this is somewhat of a basic router, it has some modern perks. It supports the most recent Internet Protocol version, IPv6. You can also create a guest network, so you don’t have to share your main network credentials with visitors. The C9 does feature parental controls, but they aren’t exactly comprehensive. Software: TP-Link Tether app You can control the router’s functions from the companion app, Tether. In the app, you can do things like set parental time limits on devices, create a guest network, block devices from the network, and perform basic network maintenance. I also recently tested the TP-Link Archer AX6000, which uses the Tether app as well. The app interface changes based on which router you’re using. With the Archer AX6000, I had more options visible because it’s a more feature-rich unit. I was impressed with the app’s ability to remove those features from the interface with the C9, instead of leaving them in place for me to click on and get that “not available with this model” message. The TP-Link site gives you access to more advanced features, like USB settings for file and printer sharing, more advanced parental controls (blocking sites), access control, DHCP settings, and forwarding and security features. Price: A budget router The Archer C9 AC1900 is an older model, so it’s not as readily available as it was a couple of years back. You can typically find it for around $120, which is a good price for a long range router with its feature set. TP-Link Archer C9 AC1900 vs. ASUS RT-AC1900 The ASUS RT-AC1900 typically sells for closer to $150, but you can find it refurbished or on sale for around the same price as the Archer AC1900. The two routers look similar at first glance—they both have three very long antennas protruding from the top. They have similar specifications, including a dual-core processor, AC1900 speed, and dual-bands, and a long range. But, the ASUS RT-AC1900 offers a few perks, like TrendMicro security and NVIDIA GameStream technology."                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Price-A-budget-router"><a href="#Price-A-budget-router" class="headerlink" title="Price: A budget router"></a><strong>Price: A budget router</strong></h2><p> The Archer C9 AC1900 is an older model, so it’s not as readily available as it was a couple of years back.

Over the years, the format has been refined, and the Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best yet for most people.</p><p> While the Apple Watch Ultra range is for advanced users keen to go diving or mountain climbing, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the watch for wearing at work before enjoying while at dinner, too.</p><p> It’s very simple to use. The only downside is that it’s an iPhone-only device. You can’t pair it with an Android phone.</p><p> If that’s not an issue, though, it simply works. At a glance, you can see what time it is, but it goes further than that, with complications allowing you to see how far you’ve walked or how many calories you’ve burned in a day.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Good looking always-on display</li><li>Customizable watch straps and watch faces</li><li>Extensive app support</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor not available in U.S.</li><li>Fitness tracking could be more refined</li><li>iPhone-only</li></ul><p> Away from the fitness side of things, the Apple Watch Series 9 allows me to pay for my groceries by tapping the watch without pulling my phone out. I can listen to music through it, too, but ultimately, the satisfying part is that it feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> There are many different watch straps and watch faces you can choose from. I favor a Peanuts-themed one with Snoopy, but there are more mature options. Sometimes, I’ve bought a new watch strap to give my watch a new lease on life so it feels shiny and new again.</p><p> Ultimately, the satisfying part is that the Apple Watch feels like it’s part of an extension of my phone and also a great-looking timepiece.</p><p> It always looks pretty new as its always-on display has scratch and crack-resistant glass over it. It’s pretty robust while looking delicate.</p><p> Plenty of sensors, like heart rate tracking and fall detection, are excellent additions for when I want to be more active. This is a watch I very rarely remove.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> Digital Trends, TechRadar, CNET, ZDNet, and PCMag all recommend the Apple Watch Series 9.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Apple Watch Series 9 has over 2,400 ratings on Amazon, with 83% of those giving the watch five stars for an average rating of 4.7 out of 5.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Android-Smartwatch"><a href="#Best-Android-Smartwatch" class="headerlink" title="Best Android Smartwatch"></a>Best Android Smartwatch</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/xnrR_eer68d0rF9QSo2fW70esEo=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungGalaxyWatch67-bf9d4b5249ab4fccbfa8b66d005e5f1b.jpg" >Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0C792QRW6" >$190 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch6-Smart-Watch-40mm-Small-Bluetooth-Graphite/3074183240?slpfid=3" >$229 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch6/buy/" >$300 at Samsung <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Sleek and stylish, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has some great features provided you’re an Android phone owner. Its body composition tool is a particular highlight.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-1"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-1" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 looks and feels lovely to use. Its circular watch face feels more natural than the angular edges of the Apple Watch. The AMOLED screen lights up nicely but in a warm and inviting way rather than harsh.</p><p> One of my favorite things about the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is its health tracking tools. It provides you with a sleep animal like Fitbit does. It also has a body composition tool that determines your body fat and other measurements. It isn’t as accurate as a set of smart scales, but it provides good insight from your wrist.  </p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Looks good</li><li>Samsung Health features are insightful</li><li>Bright and vibrant screen</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Android-only</li><li>Non Samsung users need to install extra apps</li></ul><p> Like the Apple Watch, it has only a day’s worth of battery life, which is frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world if you leave it on charge while you shower.</p><p> What is a bit more annoying is that if you use it with a non-Samsung Android phone, you’ll need to install a few different apps. It’s worth it, and I still find it the most enjoyable Android-focused watch to use, but it’s something to consider.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><p> Looking past those quibbles, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 is excellent for most purposes. It looks good on your wrist and feels comfortable without being too hefty or cumbersome. It saves you from needing to grab your phone so often, right down to the Samsung Wallet support and even a remote camera tool.</p><p> It’s a simple choice: If you own an Android phone, get this model.</p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> TechRadar, BuzzFeed, PCMag, T3, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends all recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has over 3,900 ratings on Amazon, with 88% of those rating the watch either five or four stars. The overall average rating is 4.5 out of 5.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080333/19272" target="_top" id="2080333">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080333" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080333/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Easiest-on-the-Budget"><a href="#Easiest-on-the-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Easiest on the Budget"></a>Easiest on the Budget</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >Garmin Vivoactive 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Khj7pEOVbeqTsspKEl_3pIItgxc=/fit-in/1500x3024/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GarminVivoactive53-573f048663d44d2eb0fbb8614fc6a669.jpg" >Garmin Vivoactive 5. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p> PHOTO: Lifewire &#x2F; Jennifer Allen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-v%C3%ADvoactive-Fitness-Smartwatch-Display/dp/B0CG6NR413?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8681634%7Cn8ba5509124b34540838774b103ec3bdb16%7CB0CG6NR413" >$267 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> More affordable than most Garmin watches, the Garmin Vivoactive 5 offers all the key features while not looking too sporty.</p><h3 id="Why-We-Recommend-This-2"><a href="#Why-We-Recommend-This-2" class="headerlink" title="Why We Recommend This"></a>Why We Recommend This</h3><p> A Garmin Watch is the dream for active types, but they often cost a lot and rarely look great when fine dining. The Garmin Vivoactive 5 is an affordable option that won’t look too out of place while out to impress.</p><p> It looks a little plasticky at first, but you soon get used to it, focusing your eyes on the bright AMOLED touchscreen—something that’s never guaranteed from a more budget-friendly watch.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Great battery life</li><li>Works with both iOS and Android</li><li>Body battery and stress tracking is useful</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some tools includes with more expensive Garmin watches</li><li>Could be more stylish</li></ul><p> I love how the Garmin Vivoactive 5 greets me each morning. It gave me a morning report, which told me how well I slept and my Body Battery score. The former is your guide to how far you can push it today. If it’s low, don’t go for that run. If it’s high, this is your chance to do more.</p><p> It’s an excellent guide that feels entirely accurate based on how I’m feeling at the time.</p><p> Garmin uses stress levels and how well you slept to ascertain what you should aim for. It seemed to keep up during a stressful period, even if it meant daily reminders that I was having a ‘high stress’ day and should rest more.</p><p> It’s also a durable watch, which is handy for clumsy folk like me. It tracks things like blood oxygen saturation and heart rate. There’s no Training Readiness feature like on pricier Garmin watches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 5 ticks all the boxes as a general smartwatch.</p><p> It even offers about a week’s battery life, theoretically higher depending on how you use it. It’s not as comfy as the above two watches, but it’s far cheaper. It works with both iPhones and Android phones, which is perfect if you don’t want to be too tied into an ecosystem.</p><p> Just make sure to figure out the Garmin OS as it’s a little more awkward to understand than something like watchOS, and the Garmin Vivoactive 5 doesn’t always explain things well.  </p><ul><li><strong>Who else recommends it?</strong> PCMag, CNET, Trusted Reviews, Tom’s Guide, and Digital Trends recommend the Garmin Vivoactive 5.</li><li><strong>What do buyers think?</strong> The Garmin Vivoactive 5 has over 1,800 ratings on Amazon, with 76% of them rating it five or four stars.
